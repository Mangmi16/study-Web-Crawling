      "날짜 :  26 November 2019\n",
      "내용 :  Gotham is in dire difficulties like New York City back in the 70's. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a mentally unstable clown. He laughs uncontrollably in stressful times. He gets beaten and robbed by a group of youths. He gets fired from his job. He lives with his unstable sick mom (Frances Conroy) who worked for Thomas Wayne and claims him to be her ex-lover and Arthur's biological father. When Arthur is attacked by three drunken suits in the subway, he shoots them dead. Thomas Wayne is outraged by the killing of these three well-educated pillars of society and announces his campaign for the mayor's office. Arthur has a relationship with his single-mom neighbor Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz) and admires talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro).This is great character work from Joaquin Phoenix. He is one of the great actors working today. Director Todd Phillips is pounding his chest a lot and deserves some praise. I do have a couple of problems with his work. The smaller problem is the continuous shooting of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne with her pearls. That scene has been done so many times in the past three decades. It may be better to simply suggest it with a clown walking into the alley with a gun. Don't show the shooting. Just do the sound of the shot and leave. It's all been done before and Phillips should know this. The bigger issue is setting up this world. I think Phillips expected that the audience knows this world as a given. The streets have lots of garbage. There are news reports. Phillips fails to spell it out especially if income inequality is such a big theme in the movie. It needs a Wall Street protest or two. At least, there should be a protest in front of Wayne Tower. The first clown protest against Wayne seems to come out of nowhere. The hatred of the rich needs some background. Overall, this is a great new needed voice in the comic book superhero genre which presents ground to build a new franchise on.\n",

We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film.\n",

      "내용 :  In a crumbling Gotham City, where the government has simply given up, failed clown Joaquin Phoenix goes from loser to an acclaimed clown vigilante.This movie is about the creation and rise of Batman villain The Joker. It draws on the societal collapse of the 1970s and 1980s, with references to Bernie Goetz, Robert De Niro present to make the audience think of TAXI DRIVER and his failed and insane comic in THE KING OF COMEDY. It could have been a reference to lend a veneer of cinematic respectability to this movie. Comic books arose, lazily repurposing shards of popular culture for an audience too young to recognize them for what they were, during the depths of the Depression. It was a time that led people to believe that society was in inevitable collapse; large swaths of the 2019 audience believed the same. It could have been obvious and cheap, except for all the trash in the street and Phoenix's committed performance. As it is, with the 1980s standing in for society today, society in the 1930s... Batman is not even present, just his father (who might be Phoenix's father also; emphasizing the duality that keeps being imposed on the relationship), who, it is implied, could do something, but doesn't.... well, it's a thoroughly unlikable and well made movie. Just because I don't like the message, I don't insist on shooting the messenger, even though I've heard this message many times. So the implication is that it's been ignored, and will keep being repeated until attention is paid.If only it didn't glory in the dirt and destruction.\n",

      "내용 :  What kind of Joker is this? The kind that cries on the inside.This is a Gotham Horror. Director and co-writer Todd Phillips has gone through Martin Scorsese's filmography ranging from Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, Bringing Out the Dead to Shutter Island. Robert De Niro appears as a chat show host just to drive home the Scorsese connections.The Joker delivers a bravura performance from Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. He is one of life's losers. Unable to hold down a job as a clown and on seven different kinds of medications but he is still a manic depressive.Set in the early 1980s, Gotham City is in the sewers and there are sightings of giant rats. Social services funding cuts means that Fleck is on his own. The social worker who does not even listen to him is not going to be there for him any more.Like Travis Bickle, Fleck snaps and is then reborn as the Joker. The Joker is not political but this nihilistic slow burn drama takes aim at wealthy Democrat and Republican politicians alike.Thomas Wayne might not be painted as a Trump, but he is a rich tycoon who thinks the 'have nots' are clowns. Watch out for the scene when the moguls dressed in tuxedos are watching a screening of Chaplin's Modern Times. A movie that commented on the desperate conditions many people faced during the 1930s Depression.Joker is a bold comic strip adaptation but it is a low wattage film with no plot. It is a tribute act because of the Scorsese movies that inspired it.\n",

The depiction of a deteriorating mind in this not really comic book movie, is quite something. Even Scorsese would approve I reckon. We're talking about a performance too, that really surprised me. I never thought I'd see another Joker character/actor coming close to what Heath Ledger did over a decade ago.But here we are (or are we? A question for a different time I guess), with a new Joker. But a movie or rather a story that will keep you on your feet. Joaquin is so mesmerizing that I would not be surprised if he got the Oscar. Since the nominations came out, we know this is a possibility, but everyone who watched it, was expecting him getting nominated. That the movie would get 11 nods though ... that was quite unexpected.Not all is as it seems, as with this movie being a drama rather than a \"thrill park ride\". Now that doesn't mean you have to have one thing and not the other. As a big fan of the MCU, I can admit really liking this. Then again, this is not even near the DCU ... don't compare this to something other (be it comic books or like a friend to Parasite, another favorite of mine of 2019) - enjoy it for what it is!

      "내용 :  Arthur Fleck is a clown living in Gotham City who isn't doing well. He is employed to hold an advertising banner outside a store but end up being beaten by a bunch of young thugs. His dream is of becoming a professional stand-up comedian. Whenever he gets stressed he can't help laughing. This leads to a confrontation on the subway which as fatal consequences for a trio of Wall Street types. Now the cops are looking for a killer clown. Some Gotham residents feel the victims got what they deserved leading to mayoral candidate billionaire Thomas Wayne describing the people of the city as clowns. Arthur's life becomes increasingly difficult; he learns his mother has been keeping secrets from him, cutbacks mean he loses his access to medication and talk show host Murray Franklin mocks a video of Arthur performing a stand-up routine on his show. It is only a matter of time before Arthur and the city lose control.If you go into this hoping for a fun film with a comically villainous lead you are in for quite a shock. It may be centred on a famous DC comic creation but a few name changes would lead most viewers thinking this was completely unrelated to the world of Batman. The film has a very gritty feel. We may not be told when it is set but everything we see suggests that Gotham is '70s New York. From the use of the old Warner Brothers' logo to the graffiti covered subway train, cars, TVs, indoor smoking and general decor. Joaquin Phoenix is on top form as Fleck; reminding us of De Niro at his 'Taxi Driver' best... a film that clearly helped inspire this. Another clear inspiration is another De Niro film, 'The King of Comedy'... so much so that Robert De Niro himself plays Murray Franklin, he is on fine form here. There are no super-villains (or heroes) here, just a man who is becoming increasingly dangerous and out of control. There isn't a large amount of violence but what there is is brutal, shocking and feels very real. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting a gritty character study; do not be put off if you aren't a fan of 'comic book films' as this is about as far from a typical example as it is possible to be.\n",

      "내용 :  Right, with all the praise and hype that the 2019 movie \"Joker\" from director Todd Phillips have been getting, this is very much a movie that you'd eventually find your way to watching.I did so too, and let me just say that expectations were high when I sat down to watch \"Joker\". Expectations that the movie didn't live up to. Man, this movie was definitely not my cup of tea.First of all, the pacing of the movie. Talk about being prolonged and dragging on, without nothing much of any real worth happening. Sure Joaquin Phoenix did a great job in his acting performance as Arthur Fleck and the gradual downward sloping trip towards becoming the Joker.But the storyline wasn't really one that did much to get me worked up. Director Todd Phillips took quite his time to get from A to B, and without dishing out much in terms of phenomenal storytelling and movie presentation along the way.There was one scene, a single scene, that was glorious, and it was when Arthur Fleck was on the Murray Franklin show and what happened to Murray Franklin on live TV. That scene actually had me laughing. But the rest of the movie was somewhat of a slow-paced drag to sit through. Sure, it was somewhat entertaining, but awfully slow paced. However, this is hardly a movie that I will be watching a second time around.Aside from Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, the movie also bolstered performances from the likes of Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy, whom individually were adding something good to the movie, just a shame that they didn't have more screen time.I don't understand why critics are so worked up about this movie, I honestly don't. It wasn't all that particularly outstanding or entertaining. Sure, it is a movie about an iconic villain in the DC universe, but that is about as far as it goes.I am rating this overhyped and overrated movie a less than mediocre four out of ten stars.\n",

Joaquin Phoenix is Arthur Fleck, still living in a small apartment with his mother, working menial jobs he can get with the ambition to be a successful stand up comic. But life often deals us hard knocks for no reason at all and Arthur, with his own mental illness driving him, has increasing difficulty handling them. It all comes to a head when on the subway, dressed in his clown suit after a job, when he gets accosted by three Wall Street types.The thing about the actor Phoenix, he always puts himself out there totally, he always has. He is just perfect here, his demeanor, his body language, his facial expressions, even the awkward way he runs. He deserves his Best Actor Oscar.This is set at the time when Bruce Wayne was a young boy, the time that he witnessed his parents being killed in the alley after a theater performance. There is a brief encounter at the gates of the Wayne home, of the eventual Batman and the eventual Joker.I really didn't think I'd like this movie but it really is a fine one, even though fiction of course it shows how mental illness greatly influences the trajectory of one's life. It was also fun to see Robert De Niro as late night show host Murray Franklin, patterned after the old Johnny Carson show, even with a trumpeter as the band leader.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped.

His almost schizophrenic performance is both sensitive and brutal; haunting and terrifying in equal measure; the screenplay is engrossing and Todd Phillips keeps you captivated for a terrific two hours of cinema. Given current events in Hong Kong and, to a lesser extent, the activities of Extinction Revolution; the ending depicted here does not seem nearly as far-fetched as it ought to!! Super stuff!\n",

      "날짜 :  4 October 2019\n",
      "내용 :  Gotham City. Arthur Fleck works as a clown and is also an aspiring stand-up comic. He has mental health issues, part of which involves uncontrollable laughter. Times are tough and, due to his issues and occupation, Arthur has an even worse time than most. Over time these issues bear down on him, shaping his actions, making him ultimately take on the persona he is more known as...Joker.Great drama. While the movie fits into the Batman universe, and this could easily be seen as a prequel to Joker's character in The Dark Knight (where Joker was played superbly by Heath Ledger), this is not a comic-book movie. If it was a comic-book movie, it would have ended up another one in a long, seemingly endless line of them, one hardly discernible from the next.No, this is a human/psychological drama, and a very good one. Writer-director Todd Phillips creates a dark, depressing world with Arthur Fleck one of its primary casualties. The slow, inevitable progress of Arthur Fleck from innocent man to master-criminal is an interesting journey as Phillips rachets up the tension.What was then required was a performance that captured that darkness, helplessness and gradual disintegration and Joaquin Phoenix gives that, perfectly and spectacularly. Spot-on casting and delivery.Not quite the perfect movie though. Pacing was a bit off: some scenes seem dragged out too long. I know Phillips was drawing it out to create tension and atmosphere, but on a few occasions it feels like he overdoes it.It is also difficult, from a point, to be sympathetic towards Arthur Fleck. You start out supporting him, feeling that he is a victim rather than a villain, but, as his actions become more extreme, that engagement wanes.The story also feels like it is missing something to make it 100% complete. No, I'm not expecting this to link in with The Dark Knight. In fact, many of the Batman references actually seemed unnecessary, more there for audiences to gasp and say \"Oh, so that's how Joker fits in with Batman\", rather than adding anything to this story. A few scenes beyond the final scene might have been in order, to see more of Joker's history.Overall, still a great movie though.\n",

      "내용 :  Arthur(Phoenix, Oscar-worthy yet again) is a clown for hire. He wants to cheer up the world. And to experience human connection. For someone to notice him without becoming verbally, frequently even physically, abusive. To be treated like a person. He struggles with mental illness. Both finding successful treatment, and for others to stop responding so negatively to his diagnosis. And while he feels perpetually lonely, he's not the only one to realize how bad things are getting, and how little those with money and influence do to help anyone but themselves.This is deeply messed up. It makes your mind go places you never thought it would. Including, maybe especially, when funny. In other words, it nails the core, managing to also put a fresh coat of paint on an icon with nearly 80 years of history. This explores how little sympathy and empathy(the lead only loses the audience's once he becomes a monster) is shown towards the least powerful people in society. However, it's not exclusively(albeit chiefly) about those with psychological issues. It also goes into poverty. How little those that could easily address these things even try to properly comprehend the problems. I'm not saying there's a solution that would not require time, political will and accountability for those who use their clout to try to fight these efforts. What I am saying is that we need those I'm talking about to join in the process.Taxi Driver very clearly shaped a lot of this, to incredible effect, and this film is as amazing as that one. This is the first live-action version(at least in the last 30+ years, I will grant that I am not very familiar with the takes that go back further than that) where you can understand how the Joker ends up with his signature look in a realistic world. A vigilante using martial arts and gadgets would have felt hugely out of place in this, so I'm thrilled nothing like that appears(Bruce is a child here), and I hope that this remains standalone, rather than Joaquin facing off against Batman. Keeping in mind that I love The Dark Knight trilogy.I rarely give anything the highest possible score. To me, it means that while the movie isn't perfect(that is a status that should be strived for: it can never truly be reached), there is no weakness within it that is not greatly outweighed by its positives. That's not even a contest when it comes to this. I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who worked on this for being able to say that about it.There is some bloody violence in this, a little of it immensely brutal. I recommend this to everyone who is passionate about the titular character. 10/10\n",

      "날짜 :  11 October 2019\n",
      "내용 :  It's been a long time since I've been as unsettled by a movie as I was by \"Joker.\" The last one I can think of that comes close was \"First Reformed\" from last year, another film that taps into some very dark and disturbing feelings about the state of our modern world. But that movie at least offered the possibility of hope if you were willing to interpret it a certain way, whereas \"Joker\" is about as damn near nihilistic as you can get.I didn't really even want to see this movie, because I'm sick to death of the whole superhero craze and our country's obsession with it. The Joker is one of the most overexposed of all villains, and I didn't give a rat's ass about his origin story. But the thing is, this is barely a movie about the Batman Joker. It's pretty clear that director Todd Phillips and actor Joaquin Phoenix can barely muster up the energy to tie this story into any greater mythology, and the few meager attempts to do so are the only times during the movie when my brain hit snooze and my attention drifted. The rest of the film is a deeply disturbing character study of a lone man who's so tired of trying to play by the rules of a system that has no place for him that he decides to make his own. I won't call Phoenix a revelation, because we all knew he could act, but holy cow does he do something special in this movie. This is Daniel Day-Lewis in \"There Will Be Blood\" territory we're talking about here, where the word \"acting\" seems inadequate to describe what's happening on screen.There's a lot of controversy swirling around \"Joker.\" Is it irresponsible to make a movie that basically gives lonely, angry white men a justification to carry out violent acts? Is the film just an empty, soulless, and cynical attempt to cash in on people's love of Batman and the series' villains? Is the film just ripping off of other, better movies, like \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy?\" I think people will see what they want to see in \"Joker.\" Some will see a hero figure in Arthur Fleck, and will either love or hate the movie because of it. Some will think the film is deep and profound while others will think it has nothing to say. I personally don't know that the film has anything to say, but the history of movies is full of great films that haven't necessarily \"said\" anything. \"Joker\" is a reaction to our very troubled times, and I was able to empathize with the character of Arthur Fleck to a certain point without condoning all of his actions. He's a mentally ill man who wants to get help but doesn't know how, or who's the victim of a system that doesn't care about mentally ill people. Meanwhile, the system is run by a bunch of fat cats who only care about making themselves and their cronies richer, while life for the average American gets harder and harder. Toss in our country's obsession with violence in general and guns in particular, and people like Arthur Fleck will be the inevitable result. I didn't interpret the movie as a rallying cry for incels, and I don't think it glamorized violence at all. Leave it to the \"Mission: Impossible\" movies (just as one example) to do that, yet no one ever holds movies like that to task. But I do think that more people than not may find someone to relate to in Arthur Fleck, and maybe that's what's so unsettling. Like him, and like Howard Beale, another famous movie character who's fed up with the system, I'm mad as hell, and I don't want to take it anymore. Of course I will, because I'm a rational adult who understands that progressive change moves forward in fits and starts. But wouldn't it feel just a little bit good to say screw it all and burn down the whole mess?It will be interesting to see how my reactions to \"Joker\" change over time and after we've passed this specific cultural moment. Who knows, maybe I'll think it's silly and juvenile twenty years from now when I think back on the Best Actor Oscar Joaquin Phoenix is almost certain to win. But right now, there's not a movie I've seen recently that feels more relevant or urgent than this one, and the balls this film has makes everything else currently playing look like a made-for-T.V. movie by comparison.Grade: A\n",

      "내용 :  Greetings again from the darkness. The first thing to know is that this is not a Superhero movie. In fact, there are no heroes in the movie - unless you would like to apply the label to a single mom who lives down the hall from Arthur Fleck. Mr. Fleck lives at home with his invalid mother in a grungy, run-down apartment. He works as a clown-for-hire, dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian, and depends on social services to supply the 7 medications he takes since being released from Arkham State Hospital. It's a bleak existence at a bleak time in a bleak city. Gotham is in the midst of a garbage workers' strike (only the 'super rats' are happy), political upheaval, and a growing chasm between the classes. And then it gets worse for Arthur.The second thing to know is that this is a standalone Joker film, and one mostly unrelated or not connected to previous projects featuring the colorful Clown Prince character played (and voiced) by such memorable actors as Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto and even Zach Galifianakis. Director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the script with Scott Silver) is best known for such extreme comedies as \"The Hangover\" franchise and OLD SCHOOL, so he's a bit outside of his usual wheelhouse. Phillips and Silver seem to embrace not just the history of the character, but also the look, texture and tone of filmmaking from an earlier era. The gritty and outcast feel of Scorcese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING OF COMEDY is present, and so are numerous tributes to familiar Joker moments of days gone by.Three time Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, and he delivers Arthur's slow descent into madness, or shall we say further descent. It's clear from the beginning that Arthur views himself as ignored by society, while all he wants to do is bring joy and laughter to others ... and be noticed. His daydreams or visions of himself in a better world send a strong message. Phoenix shows us what full commitment to a role looks like. He lost 50 pounds, leaving a frame that contorts, moves and dances in a manner unlike what we've seen before. In fact, it's a toss-up on which shows up more frequently, his dances moves or his maniacal, pained laughter. We are informed Arthur suffers from Pseudobulbar Affect, also known as emotional incontinence, which causes that creepy laughter to pop up at some inappropriate times. Of course, the comparisons to Heath Ledger's Oscar winning turn in THE DARK KNIGHT are inevitable. The roles and films are written quite differently, and it's safe to say both actors were all-in.Action sequences and special visual effects are both noticeably absent, but the violence is sure to shock. This is not one for the younger kids, no matter how much they enjoy THE AVENGERS or WONDER WOMAN (or any other DC or Marvel film). This gritty, visceral approach is often a tough watch, and is much more a character study of mental illness than a costume drama ... although Arthur's clothes and make-up are front and center. When Arthur states, \"I have nothing but bad thoughts\", we believe him. And the sympathetic back story explains a great deal, and will likely prove quite controversial.Phoenix dominates the film (as he should), and supporting work is provided by Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a TV talk show host in the Johnny Carson mode; Zazie Beetz (DEADPOOL 2) as the single mom neighbor Sophie Dumond; Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck, Arthur's mother; Brett Cullen as a not so empathetic Thomas Wayne; and Shea Whigham and Bill Camp as police detectives. I'll hesitantly mention that Dante Pereira-Olson makes a couple of brief appearances as an adolescent Bruce Wayne, and just for fun, we get a shot of the young man honing the batpole skills he will use later in life. Just don't expect any \"real\" Batman references.Director Phillips delivers a film that looks and feels and sounds much different than other comic book movies. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher is a frequent Phillips collaborator (all 3 Hangover movies) and the dark look and gritty feel are present in most every shot. Hildur Guonadottir (this year's Emmy winner for \"Chernobyl\") serves up a foreboding score - one that never overwhelms, and one that contrasts perfectly with the more traditional songs utilized throughout: Stephen Sondheim's \"Send in the Clowns\", Jimmy Durante singing \"Smile\", Cream's \"White Room\", \"That's Life\" by Frank Sinatra, and Gary Glitter's familiar \"Rock and Roll Part 1 and 2\". The \"Smile\" song is especially relevant as its origins can be traced by to Charlie Chaplin's MODERN TIMES, a silent movie classic featured in this film. Phillips even uses the Saul Bass designed Warner Bros logo to open the credits, making sure we understand the time period (no cell phones, etc).The film traces Arthur's slide into crime ... a transition that he wasn't seeking, and one that he believes was forced upon him. His rise as a savior to the working class is secondary to his own journey, and the chaos is handled on the perimeters of the film, preventing this from becoming a Super Villain movie. Keep in mind JOKER played at Venice, Telluride and Toronto - three prestigious festivals. This is just another thing that sets it apart from others in the genre. Despite the 1981 time stamp, the consistent anti-rich message and class disparity is prevalent throughout. This appears to be Phillips' way of including a contemporary theme in a decades-old setting. And it's a cautionary tale that there should be no clown left behind.\n",

Brett Cullen is on hand as Thomas Wayne, Bruce's rich father.\"Joker\" (2019) is an arty, slow-burn character study of the popular DC Comics' villain, but it's more of a psychological crime drama/thriller and tragedy than a superhero flick (or, in this case, supervillain).

It's heavy and tragic. But what's the message? Simply that this is how a quirky man who wanted to make people laugh became The Joker.

      "내용 :  For those wondering how a film about a comic book character, especially the Joker from DC Comics, could ever win an Academy Award, then join the doubters and watch this film JOKER: Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant in a role that is anything but comic in a film written by Scott Silver and Director Todd Phillips. Yes, the story, at the end, introduces the young Bruce Wayne aka Batman, in a subtle manner, but the message of the film is not the stuff of which DC/Marvel comics are made. This is a serious film about mentally ill people and the disinvolvement with a society that seems to care little about their status.Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) lives with his mentally impaired mother Penny (Frances Conroy) who is obsessed with communication with the mayor elect of Gotham City - Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). Arthur works in a clown studio and we meet him in clown costume and makeup as he is parading a sign about a store that is closing facing financial failure. A group of kids steal the sign from Arthur and upon chasing them, Arthur is felled and beaten. Arthur is stricken with Pseudobulbar Affect - spontaneous uncontrollable laughter - a condition that alters his responses to almost everything. On a subway, in his clown outfit, he is maligned by three 'Wall Street rich guys' and Arthur murders them - the beginning of his downfall. The bud of the schism between the haves and the have-nots (financial inequity) opens, and in the process Arthur discovers his father may be Thomas Wayne (the reason for his ex-housekeeper mother Jenny's constant letters) and Arthur goes to Wayne's mansion to meet - a major mistake and another mishap. Finally caught by the police after Arthur's clown face is posted on the news as the clown subway killer, and after guest appearing on the Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro) comedy show, Arthur breaks and is institutionalized while a city of clown-masked protestors against the wealthy booms. The ending is particularly dramatic: Thomas Wayne's son Bruce (!) - Dante Pereira-Olson) - ignites.Tough story to watch, but an important statement on many levels, this film deserves the honors it has received. Joaquin Phoenix is most impressive, as is the entire cast.\n",

He's a man in desperate need of help. Unfortunately, Gotham city isn't the place to find it. As his mind begins to shatter, Arthur has no idea what's coming his way. He simply finds his strength in a sudden act of violence, and somehow taps into the void within those around him, ultimately becoming a sort of messiah.The mesmerizing Mr. Phoenix uses his body as much as his dialogue to bring both Arthur and his alter ego to life. This is a movie to be watched and taken seriously, in spite of its comic book origins. It's as much a serious statement as it is entertainment. Multiple viewings recommended...\n",

So this was told to be the best flick of 2019, So many things were said and so I was afraid it was overhyped.Let me tell you, not one bit. First of all, happy to see Robert De Niro back in a flick that suits him. No more comedies please Robert. Secondly, the comparing all over the net between Ledger and Phoenix. They are both excellent in their own ways.The movie itself. Starts off rather as a normal flick, except for opening credits which took me back to the old WB logo's and yellow lettering of the seventies, but quickly turns into a dark movie getting darker and darker and more and more insane. The way it was shot, the score my God, really well done.And then there's the performance that couldn't beat Ledger. Well, Ledger I do still like as the Joker but what Phoenix did as the sart of the Joker is really really worth the Oscar. The skinny body, the laughter, the sick looks. with De Niro in it it did remind me of Taxi Driver who one person can turn from a desperate person into a mad person.Towards the end I was thinking, okay, so far 10 out of 10 but are they going to ruin the link towards Batman. They didn't, the last 15 minutes, man, it fits perfectly into the Batman world.It's been a while I have seen such a flick, and after some Marvel rather boring stuff (Avengers Endgame for example) again I was shown that DC is my thing.I can go on and on. The impossible mission to beat Ledger, well, the Oscars will proof that it has been done.Be warned, rated 16+, totally correct due the brutal action and the downward spiral of the storyGore 0/5\n",

That aside Joker is so much more than the comic figure we're used to. The Batman versus Joker war is not even important in this story, it's just about somebody that starts to lose it in the real world, someone that is just fed up with society, with the meaness of people. Maybe he has some mental issues but I'm sure a lot of people just understand perfectly why he becomes The Joker. Joker is definitely one of the better movies from this year, anyone that doesn't see that just has an awful taste when it comes to masterpieces.\n",

The same slow descent into madness for a disillusioned and ignored man at the edge of society.I didn't find the film political at all. Because what Phoenix did I felt for his character at a visceral level, beyond good, evil and morality. The entire movie is a joke that only some people get it. The incel thing, for example, was hilarious in retrospect: frightened first worlders trying to instantly put a label on the people that they feared most and needed support more. The exact same reaction as portrayed in the film. The story in this is very personal, in a social context that becomes a constant buzz that fades in the background.If there is any word that could describe Joker is uncomfortable. It's two hours of feeling the suffering of the main character, even as he breaks and does unconscionable things. You can't not root for him. You can't condone it. You can't not be sad. And in the end, when I was thinking this is a great movie but has nothing to do with the DC comics, it ties in the Batman classic storyline with such ease that I couldn't help shivering thinking on what Batman's story would be in this universe of burning sadness.Bottom line: great acting and really fresh ideas that work together perfectly. It's a very adult film, though, and not for everybody.\n",

      "내용 :  \"I used to think that my life was a tragedy, but now I realize, it's a comedy.\" Arthur Fleck aka Joker (Joaquin Phoenix)\n",
      "\"Joker\" has many faces, the two most prominent are tragedy and comedy. The tragedy is played amid murders and childhood abuse. The comedy comes intermittently, mostly as an accompaniment to the tragedy. Both modes amply identify Arthur Fleck, aka Joker, as a misfit and psycho, for whom only murder can make him feel alive.With the exception of Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, no better psychological study has come by than with Joaquin Phoenix as the troubled enemy of Batman. He may win the best-acting Oscar unless a more riveting anti-hero emerges before the end of the year.Besides Taxi Driver, another Scorsese influence shows Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a talk show host, who befriends Joker, a failed stand-up comedian. As in The King of Comedy, where De Niro's Rupert Pupkin pursues comedian Jerry Lewis, Joker \"befriends\" De Niro as talk-show host. Both films are aces at showing a character on the fringe of society, in Joker's case a nut job from neglect as an orphan, who kills Bruce Wayne's parents and his own mother.To see Arthur, evolve into Joker is to watch a master actor take a nerdy a-social kid to a serial killer, a fitting antagonist for Bruce Wayne, who saw Arthur murder his parents.Beyond the physical mutation of losing a Christian Bale-like fifty pounds, Phoenix consistently uses tics and laughs to emphasize how out of the center he is. The laughing condition, occurring randomly, is an apt metaphor for his inability to tell a joke or to fit normally in society. \"I just don't want to feel so bad anymore,\" Arthur whispers. It's hard to imagine he could ever feel well given he takes five different medications.As Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger showed, the joker character holds multitudes within his persona, enough for more than two hours of any film. Todd Philips directs an origin story about a psychopathic murderer who devolves along with the society he hates:\n",

      "내용 :  Many of us over the years have been attached and thrilled with the \"Clown Prince of Crime\" as D.C. comic fans know as the one and only \"Joker\". And we've seen different takes and spins from Romero's camp, to Ledger's dark wild crazy turn, and the man the one and only Jack played the clown with vanity and brought a proper turn to a bad guy while having fun(Nicholson's \"Joker\" was like that of the late 70's early 80's \"Joker\" in D.C. comics) now enter Phoenix who's much different with a creepy origin story.Set in the early 1980's Gotham city is gritty, raw and the social and political climate is in the gutter as just getting by is so tough. And just tip toeing and dancing his way thru the drama is Arthur Fleck(in a hell of a turn from Joaquin at least nominate him for a \"Golden Globe\" or \"Oscar\") a lonely and depressed mommies boy who's a skinny starving clown who just can't fit in he's a society misfit. It's really somewhat of a sad character study.However hope is possible in the form of Fleck wanting to get away from being a clown for children as his real dream is to be a standup comedian as his smile and crazy lasting laugh is always present! As laughter is the cure for his pain! His hope of escape is to appear on a late night talk show hosted by Murray Franklin(Robert De Niro) where Arthur hopes to showcase his talents. Also the only other wild card pleasure he has in his life is dating a single mom named Sophie(Zazie Beetz) from his apartment building. And his sick mother Penny keeps Arthur hanging on with love and hope as that keeps him hanging on.Only secrets and ghost of the past and painful memories only destroy the fragile mind of Arthur even more as a connection to millionaire Thomas Wayne is revealed and even more shattering is how this connection and more events will lead to \"The Dark Knight\". Great and excellent work from director Todd Phillips who despite making a stand alone dark character study still connects things up with others in the D.C. universe.Many might see this picture as a dark tragedy I think it's a take and spin on how one is affected by life and then they take on a different role after years of being abused and mistreated in the world by it's people. Still this film is excellent because it's unique and finally glad a stand alone movie celebrates \"The Joker\"(the greatest comic book bad guy ever!) As Joaquin's performance was raw, gritty, and a lashing out of some payback to society. Wow enough said best D.C. comics character study ever made!\n",

      "내용 :  Asserting as a one-off enterprise from DC universe and starting the original story of Arthur Fleck aka. The Joker (Phoenix) in 1981, director Todd Phillips (hailed from the THE HANGOVER trilogy fame), first thing first, has done a mind-blowing job in exbibiting a tangible retro flair from the film's imposing set design, a refuse-ridden, duck egg blue-hued Gothom City where anarchy is brewing at every sleazy corner, in tandem with Hildur Guðnadóttir's forboding symphonic score, it set the film's overall unforgiving keynote up to the eleven. And JOKER's closest kindred spirit might rightly be Martin Scorsese's seminal work TAXI DRIVER (1976), with a knowing nod to THE KING OF COMEDY (1982), not least hinted by Robert De Niro's presence here, and it palpably belongs to the veritable \"true cinema\" which Scorsese laments in his recent comments about DC's rival, Marvel's superhero movies.It is somewhat disconcerting (but not entirely unexpected) to learn Phillips' Venice Golden Lion winner is met with polarized reactions among critics stateside albeit being a legitimate box office leviathan by breaking all the October records in its opening week and audience simply adores it. Quite accountable, Phillips and his co-writer Scott Silver's script pluckily touches a raw nerve by lending an uncompromising view on the societal genesis of Arthur's violent predisposition - sowed by the disenfranchisement and impoverishment stonewalled by the plutocratic ruling class, represented by the future Batman's father Thomas Wayne (Cullen) and incited by the anomie and apathy Arthur faces on a daily basis....\n",

      "내용 :  In the non-canonical origin story Joker, Joaquin Phoenix plays a deeply disturbed man named Arthur Fleck as he experiences through a series of traumas that turn him into the notorious supervillain.Phoenix is terrific as the agonized loser with a compulsive-laughter condition. He's weird and creepy and full of angst and anger and self-loathing and everyone-else-loathing.The first half hour is simply a grinding, agonizingly slow moving portrayal of Arthur's life. Then there's a moment of stunning, electrifying violence. And then everything gets tedious again.Joker is not a supervillain movie, it's an artsy character study, and if you like those then this might appeal to you. But there's a superficiality to it all. Arthur is deeply disturbed and living in a city where society's have-nots are increasingly disenfranchised, but the script and director don't really seem to have anything to say about mental illness or inequality and injustice.In the run-up to the film, director Todd Phillips criticized \"woke\" culture and the far left, and perhaps that's part of the problem. Woke culture says we need to think about things deeply, and Phillips really, really seem loathe to delve into what it means to be mentally unstable and poor in the greater societal sense. He's only concerned with how it effects Arthur. Arthur is also only concerned with how it effects Arthur, and the result is a film that seems to accept that Arthur is a victim of an unjust society while never really considering why the society is unjust or how much of Arthur's problems might be the result of his own narcissistic self pity.But the main problem with the movie is it's slow-moving and dull far more often than not. I wouldn't recommend it.\n",
