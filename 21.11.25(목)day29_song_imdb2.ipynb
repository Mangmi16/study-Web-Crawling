      "날짜 :  26 November 2019\n",
      "내용 :  Gotham is in dire difficulties like New York City back in the 70's. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a mentally unstable clown. He laughs uncontrollably in stressful times. He gets beaten and robbed by a group of youths. He gets fired from his job. He lives with his unstable sick mom (Frances Conroy) who worked for Thomas Wayne and claims him to be her ex-lover and Arthur's biological father. When Arthur is attacked by three drunken suits in the subway, he shoots them dead. Thomas Wayne is outraged by the killing of these three well-educated pillars of society and announces his campaign for the mayor's office. Arthur has a relationship with his single-mom neighbor Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz) and admires talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro).This is great character work from Joaquin Phoenix. He is one of the great actors working today. Director Todd Phillips is pounding his chest a lot and deserves some praise. I do have a couple of problems with his work. The smaller problem is the continuous shooting of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne with her pearls. That scene has been done so many times in the past three decades. It may be better to simply suggest it with a clown walking into the alley with a gun. Don't show the shooting. Just do the sound of the shot and leave. It's all been done before and Phillips should know this. The bigger issue is setting up this world. I think Phillips expected that the audience knows this world as a given. The streets have lots of garbage. There are news reports. Phillips fails to spell it out especially if income inequality is such a big theme in the movie. It needs a Wall Street protest or two. At least, there should be a protest in front of Wayne Tower. The first clown protest against Wayne seems to come out of nowhere. The hatred of the rich needs some background. Overall, this is a great new needed voice in the comic book superhero genre which presents ground to build a new franchise on.\n",

We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film.\n",

      "내용 :  In a crumbling Gotham City, where the government has simply given up, failed clown Joaquin Phoenix goes from loser to an acclaimed clown vigilante.This movie is about the creation and rise of Batman villain The Joker. It draws on the societal collapse of the 1970s and 1980s, with references to Bernie Goetz, Robert De Niro present to make the audience think of TAXI DRIVER and his failed and insane comic in THE KING OF COMEDY. It could have been a reference to lend a veneer of cinematic respectability to this movie. Comic books arose, lazily repurposing shards of popular culture for an audience too young to recognize them for what they were, during the depths of the Depression. It was a time that led people to believe that society was in inevitable collapse; large swaths of the 2019 audience believed the same. It could have been obvious and cheap, except for all the trash in the street and Phoenix's committed performance. As it is, with the 1980s standing in for society today, society in the 1930s... Batman is not even present, just his father (who might be Phoenix's father also; emphasizing the duality that keeps being imposed on the relationship), who, it is implied, could do something, but doesn't.... well, it's a thoroughly unlikable and well made movie. Just because I don't like the message, I don't insist on shooting the messenger, even though I've heard this message many times. So the implication is that it's been ignored, and will keep being repeated until attention is paid.If only it didn't glory in the dirt and destruction.\n",

      "내용 :  What kind of Joker is this? The kind that cries on the inside.This is a Gotham Horror. Director and co-writer Todd Phillips has gone through Martin Scorsese's filmography ranging from Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, Bringing Out the Dead to Shutter Island. Robert De Niro appears as a chat show host just to drive home the Scorsese connections.The Joker delivers a bravura performance from Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. He is one of life's losers. Unable to hold down a job as a clown and on seven different kinds of medications but he is still a manic depressive.Set in the early 1980s, Gotham City is in the sewers and there are sightings of giant rats. Social services funding cuts means that Fleck is on his own. The social worker who does not even listen to him is not going to be there for him any more.Like Travis Bickle, Fleck snaps and is then reborn as the Joker. The Joker is not political but this nihilistic slow burn drama takes aim at wealthy Democrat and Republican politicians alike.Thomas Wayne might not be painted as a Trump, but he is a rich tycoon who thinks the 'have nots' are clowns. Watch out for the scene when the moguls dressed in tuxedos are watching a screening of Chaplin's Modern Times. A movie that commented on the desperate conditions many people faced during the 1930s Depression.Joker is a bold comic strip adaptation but it is a low wattage film with no plot. It is a tribute act because of the Scorsese movies that inspired it.\n",

The depiction of a deteriorating mind in this not really comic book movie, is quite something. Even Scorsese would approve I reckon. We're talking about a performance too, that really surprised me. I never thought I'd see another Joker character/actor coming close to what Heath Ledger did over a decade ago.But here we are (or are we? A question for a different time I guess), with a new Joker. But a movie or rather a story that will keep you on your feet. Joaquin is so mesmerizing that I would not be surprised if he got the Oscar. Since the nominations came out, we know this is a possibility, but everyone who watched it, was expecting him getting nominated. That the movie would get 11 nods though ... that was quite unexpected.Not all is as it seems, as with this movie being a drama rather than a \"thrill park ride\". Now that doesn't mean you have to have one thing and not the other. As a big fan of the MCU, I can admit really liking this. Then again, this is not even near the DCU ... don't compare this to something other (be it comic books or like a friend to Parasite, another favorite of mine of 2019) - enjoy it for what it is!

      "내용 :  Arthur Fleck is a clown living in Gotham City who isn't doing well. He is employed to hold an advertising banner outside a store but end up being beaten by a bunch of young thugs. His dream is of becoming a professional stand-up comedian. Whenever he gets stressed he can't help laughing. This leads to a confrontation on the subway which as fatal consequences for a trio of Wall Street types. Now the cops are looking for a killer clown. Some Gotham residents feel the victims got what they deserved leading to mayoral candidate billionaire Thomas Wayne describing the people of the city as clowns. Arthur's life becomes increasingly difficult; he learns his mother has been keeping secrets from him, cutbacks mean he loses his access to medication and talk show host Murray Franklin mocks a video of Arthur performing a stand-up routine on his show. It is only a matter of time before Arthur and the city lose control.If you go into this hoping for a fun film with a comically villainous lead you are in for quite a shock. It may be centred on a famous DC comic creation but a few name changes would lead most viewers thinking this was completely unrelated to the world of Batman. The film has a very gritty feel. We may not be told when it is set but everything we see suggests that Gotham is '70s New York. From the use of the old Warner Brothers' logo to the graffiti covered subway train, cars, TVs, indoor smoking and general decor. Joaquin Phoenix is on top form as Fleck; reminding us of De Niro at his 'Taxi Driver' best... a film that clearly helped inspire this. Another clear inspiration is another De Niro film, 'The King of Comedy'... so much so that Robert De Niro himself plays Murray Franklin, he is on fine form here. There are no super-villains (or heroes) here, just a man who is becoming increasingly dangerous and out of control. There isn't a large amount of violence but what there is is brutal, shocking and feels very real. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting a gritty character study; do not be put off if you aren't a fan of 'comic book films' as this is about as far from a typical example as it is possible to be.\n",

      "내용 :  Right, with all the praise and hype that the 2019 movie \"Joker\" from director Todd Phillips have been getting, this is very much a movie that you'd eventually find your way to watching.I did so too, and let me just say that expectations were high when I sat down to watch \"Joker\". Expectations that the movie didn't live up to. Man, this movie was definitely not my cup of tea.First of all, the pacing of the movie. Talk about being prolonged and dragging on, without nothing much of any real worth happening. Sure Joaquin Phoenix did a great job in his acting performance as Arthur Fleck and the gradual downward sloping trip towards becoming the Joker.But the storyline wasn't really one that did much to get me worked up. Director Todd Phillips took quite his time to get from A to B, and without dishing out much in terms of phenomenal storytelling and movie presentation along the way.There was one scene, a single scene, that was glorious, and it was when Arthur Fleck was on the Murray Franklin show and what happened to Murray Franklin on live TV. That scene actually had me laughing. But the rest of the movie was somewhat of a slow-paced drag to sit through. Sure, it was somewhat entertaining, but awfully slow paced. However, this is hardly a movie that I will be watching a second time around.Aside from Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, the movie also bolstered performances from the likes of Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy, whom individually were adding something good to the movie, just a shame that they didn't have more screen time.I don't understand why critics are so worked up about this movie, I honestly don't. It wasn't all that particularly outstanding or entertaining. Sure, it is a movie about an iconic villain in the DC universe, but that is about as far as it goes.I am rating this overhyped and overrated movie a less than mediocre four out of ten stars.\n",

Joaquin Phoenix is Arthur Fleck, still living in a small apartment with his mother, working menial jobs he can get with the ambition to be a successful stand up comic. But life often deals us hard knocks for no reason at all and Arthur, with his own mental illness driving him, has increasing difficulty handling them.

He is just perfect here, his demeanor, his body language, his facial expressions, even the awkward way he runs. He deserves his Best Actor Oscar.This is set at the time when Bruce Wayne was a young boy, the time that he witnessed his parents being killed in the alley after a theater performance. There is a brief encounter at the gates of the Wayne home, of the eventual Batman and the eventual Joker.I really didn't think I'd like this movie but it really is a fine one, even though fiction of course it shows how mental illness greatly influences the trajectory of one's life. It was also fun to see Robert De Niro as late night show host Murray Franklin, patterned after the old Johnny Carson show, even with a trumpeter as the band leader.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped. The disc has a number of worthwhile \"extras.\"\n",

      "날짜 :  4 October 2019\n",
      "내용 :  Gotham City. Arthur Fleck works as a clown and is also an aspiring stand-up comic. He has mental health issues, part of which involves uncontrollable laughter. Times are tough and, due to his issues and occupation, Arthur has an even worse time than most. Over time these issues bear down on him, shaping his actions, making him ultimately take on the persona he is more known as...Joker.Great drama. While the movie fits into the Batman universe, and this could easily be seen as a prequel to Joker's character in The Dark Knight (where Joker was played superbly by Heath Ledger), this is not a comic-book movie. If it was a comic-book movie, it would have ended up another one in a long, seemingly endless line of them, one hardly discernible from the next.No, this is a human/psychological drama, and a very good one. Writer-director Todd Phillips creates a dark, depressing world with Arthur Fleck one of its primary casualties. The slow, inevitable progress of Arthur Fleck from innocent man to master-criminal is an interesting journey as Phillips rachets up the tension.What was then required was a performance that captured that darkness, helplessness and gradual disintegration and Joaquin Phoenix gives that, perfectly and spectacularly. Spot-on casting and delivery.Not quite the perfect movie though. Pacing was a bit off: some scenes seem dragged out too long. I know Phillips was drawing it out to create tension and atmosphere, but on a few occasions it feels like he overdoes it.It is also difficult, from a point, to be sympathetic towards Arthur Fleck. You start out supporting him, feeling that he is a victim rather than a villain, but, as his actions become more extreme, that engagement wanes.The story also feels like it is missing something to make it 100% complete. No, I'm not expecting this to link in with The Dark Knight. In fact, many of the Batman references actually seemed unnecessary, more there for audiences to gasp and say \"Oh, so that's how Joker fits in with Batman\", rather than adding anything to this story. A few scenes beyond the final scene might have been in order, to see more of Joker's history.Overall, still a great movie though.\n",

      "내용 :  Arthur(Phoenix, Oscar-worthy yet again) is a clown for hire. He wants to cheer up the world. And to experience human connection. For someone to notice him without becoming verbally, frequently even physically, abusive. To be treated like a person. He struggles with mental illness. Both finding successful treatment, and for others to stop responding so negatively to his diagnosis. And while he feels perpetually lonely, he's not the only one to realize how bad things are getting, and how little those with money and influence do to help anyone but themselves.This is deeply messed up. It makes your mind go places you never thought it would. Including, maybe especially, when funny. In other words, it nails the core, managing to also put a fresh coat of paint on an icon with nearly 80 years of history. This explores how little sympathy and empathy(the lead only loses the audience's once he becomes a monster) is shown towards the least powerful people in society. However, it's not exclusively(albeit chiefly) about those with psychological issues. It also goes into poverty. How little those that could easily address these things even try to properly comprehend the problems. I'm not saying there's a solution that would not require time, political will and accountability for those who use their clout to try to fight these efforts. What I am saying is that we need those I'm talking about to join in the process.Taxi Driver very clearly shaped a lot of this, to incredible effect, and this film is as amazing as that one. This is the first live-action version(at least in the last 30+ years, I will grant that I am not very familiar with the takes that go back further than that) where you can understand how the Joker ends up with his signature look in a realistic world. A vigilante using martial arts and gadgets would have felt hugely out of place in this, so I'm thrilled nothing like that appears(Bruce is a child here), and I hope that this remains standalone, rather than Joaquin facing off against Batman. Keeping in mind that I love The Dark Knight trilogy.I rarely give anything the highest possible score. To me, it means that while the movie isn't perfect(that is a status that should be strived for: it can never truly be reached), there is no weakness within it that is not greatly outweighed by its positives. That's not even a contest when it comes to this. I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who worked on this for being able to say that about it.There is some bloody violence in this, a little of it immensely brutal. I recommend this to everyone who is passionate about the titular character. 10/10\n",

      "날짜 :  11 October 2019\n",
      "내용 :  It's been a long time since I've been as unsettled by a movie as I was by \"Joker.\" The last one I can think of that comes close was \"First Reformed\" from last year, another film that taps into some very dark and disturbing feelings about the state of our modern world. But that movie at least offered the possibility of hope if you were willing to interpret it a certain way, whereas \"Joker\" is about as damn near nihilistic as you can get.I didn't really even want to see this movie, because I'm sick to death of the whole superhero craze and our country's obsession with it. The Joker is one of the most overexposed of all villains, and I didn't give a rat's ass about his origin story. But the thing is, this is barely a movie about the Batman Joker. It's pretty clear that director Todd Phillips and actor Joaquin Phoenix can barely muster up the energy to tie this story into any greater mythology, and the few meager attempts to do so are the only times during the movie when my brain hit snooze and my attention drifted. The rest of the film is a deeply disturbing character study of a lone man who's so tired of trying to play by the rules of a system that has no place for him that he decides to make his own. I won't call Phoenix a revelation, because we all knew he could act, but holy cow does he do something special in this movie. This is Daniel Day-Lewis in \"There Will Be Blood\" territory we're talking about here, where the word \"acting\" seems inadequate to describe what's happening on screen.There's a lot of controversy swirling around \"Joker.\" Is it irresponsible to make a movie that basically gives lonely, angry white men a justification to carry out violent acts? Is the film just an empty, soulless, and cynical attempt to cash in on people's love of Batman and the series' villains? Is the film just ripping off of other, better movies, like \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy?\" I think people will see what they want to see in \"Joker.\" Some will see a hero figure in Arthur Fleck, and will either love or hate the movie because of it. Some will think the film is deep and profound while others will think it has nothing to say. I personally don't know that the film has anything to say, but the history of movies is full of great films that haven't necessarily \"said\" anything. \"Joker\" is a reaction to our very troubled times, and I was able to empathize with the character of Arthur Fleck to a certain point without condoning all of his actions. He's a mentally ill man who wants to get help but doesn't know how, or who's the victim of a system that doesn't care about mentally ill people. Meanwhile, the system is run by a bunch of fat cats who only care about making themselves and their cronies richer, while life for the average American gets harder and harder. Toss in our country's obsession with violence in general and guns in particular, and people like Arthur Fleck will be the inevitable result. I didn't interpret the movie as a rallying cry for incels, and I don't think it glamorized violence at all. Leave it to the \"Mission: Impossible\" movies (just as one example) to do that, yet no one ever holds movies like that to task. But I do think that more people than not may find someone to relate to in Arthur Fleck, and maybe that's what's so unsettling. Like him, and like Howard Beale, another famous movie character who's fed up with the system, I'm mad as hell, and I don't want to take it anymore. Of course I will, because I'm a rational adult who understands that progressive change moves forward in fits and starts. But wouldn't it feel just a little bit good to say screw it all and burn down the whole mess?It will be interesting to see how my reactions to \"Joker\" change over time and after we've passed this specific cultural moment. Who knows, maybe I'll think it's silly and juvenile twenty years from now when I think back on the Best Actor Oscar Joaquin Phoenix is almost certain to win. But right now, there's not a movie I've seen recently that feels more relevant or urgent than this one, and the balls this film has makes everything else currently playing look like a made-for-T.V. movie by comparison.Grade: A\n",

      "내용 :  Greetings again from the darkness. The first thing to know is that this is not a Superhero movie. In fact, there are no heroes in the movie - unless you would like to apply the label to a single mom who lives down the hall from Arthur Fleck. Mr. Fleck lives at home with his invalid mother in a grungy, run-down apartment. He works as a clown-for-hire, dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian, and depends on social services to supply the 7 medications he takes since being released from Arkham State Hospital. It's a bleak existence at a bleak time in a bleak city. Gotham is in the midst of a garbage workers' strike (only the 'super rats' are happy), political upheaval, and a growing chasm between the classes. And then it gets worse for Arthur.The second thing to know is that this is a standalone Joker film, and one mostly unrelated or not connected to previous projects featuring the colorful Clown Prince character played (and voiced) by such memorable actors as Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto and even Zach Galifianakis. Director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the script with Scott Silver) is best known for such extreme comedies as \"The Hangover\" franchise and OLD SCHOOL, so he's a bit outside of his usual wheelhouse. Phillips and Silver seem to embrace not just the history of the character, but also the look, texture and tone of filmmaking from an earlier era. The gritty and outcast feel of Scorcese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING OF COMEDY is present, and so are numerous tributes to familiar Joker moments of days gone by.Three time Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, and he delivers Arthur's slow descent into madness, or shall we say further descent. It's clear from the beginning that Arthur views himself as ignored by society, while all he wants to do is bring joy and laughter to others ... and be noticed. His daydreams or visions of himself in a better world send a strong message. Phoenix shows us what full commitment to a role looks like. He lost 50 pounds, leaving a frame that contorts, moves and dances in a manner unlike what we've seen before. In fact, it's a toss-up on which shows up more frequently, his dances moves or his maniacal, pained laughter. We are informed Arthur suffers from Pseudobulbar Affect, also known as emotional incontinence, which causes that creepy laughter to pop up at some inappropriate times. Of course, the comparisons to Heath Ledger's Oscar winning turn in THE DARK KNIGHT are inevitable. The roles and films are written quite differently, and it's safe to say both actors were all-in.Action sequences and special visual effects are both noticeably absent, but the violence is sure to shock. This is not one for the younger kids, no matter how much they enjoy THE AVENGERS or WONDER WOMAN (or any other DC or Marvel film). This gritty, visceral approach is often a tough watch, and is much more a character study of mental illness than a costume drama ... although Arthur's clothes and make-up are front and center. When Arthur states, \"I have nothing but bad thoughts\", we believe him. And the sympathetic back story explains a great deal, and will likely prove quite controversial.Phoenix dominates the film (as he should), and supporting work is provided by Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a TV talk show host in the Johnny Carson mode; Zazie Beetz (DEADPOOL 2) as the single mom neighbor Sophie Dumond; Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck, Arthur's mother; Brett Cullen as a not so empathetic Thomas Wayne; and Shea Whigham and Bill Camp as police detectives. I'll hesitantly mention that Dante Pereira-Olson makes a couple of brief appearances as an adolescent Bruce Wayne, and just for fun, we get a shot of the young man honing the batpole skills he will use later in life. Just don't expect any \"real\" Batman references.Director Phillips delivers a film that looks and feels and sounds much different than other comic book movies. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher is a frequent Phillips collaborator (all 3 Hangover movies) and the dark look and gritty feel are present in most every shot. Hildur Guonadottir (this year's Emmy winner for \"Chernobyl\") serves up a foreboding score - one that never overwhelms, and one that contrasts perfectly with the more traditional songs utilized throughout: Stephen Sondheim's \"Send in the Clowns\", Jimmy Durante singing \"Smile\", Cream's \"White Room\", \"That's Life\" by Frank Sinatra, and Gary Glitter's familiar \"Rock and Roll Part 1 and 2\". The \"Smile\" song is especially relevant as its origins can be traced by to Charlie Chaplin's MODERN TIMES, a silent movie classic featured in this film. Phillips even uses the Saul Bass designed Warner Bros logo to open the credits, making sure we understand the time period (no cell phones, etc).The film traces Arthur's slide into crime ... a transition that he wasn't seeking, and one that he believes was forced upon him. His rise as a savior to the working class is secondary to his own journey, and the chaos is handled on the perimeters of the film, preventing this from becoming a Super Villain movie. Keep in mind JOKER played at Venice, Telluride and Toronto - three prestigious festivals. This is just another thing that sets it apart from others in the genre. Despite the 1981 time stamp, the consistent anti-rich message and class disparity is prevalent throughout. This appears to be Phillips' way of including a contemporary theme in a decades-old setting. And it's a cautionary tale that there should be no clown left behind.\n",

Brett Cullen is on hand as Thomas Wayne, Bruce's rich father.\"Joker\" (2019) is an arty, slow-burn character study of the popular DC Comics' villain, but it's more of a psychological crime drama/thriller and tragedy than a superhero flick (or, in this case, supervillain).

It's heavy and tragic. But what's the message? Simply that this is how a quirky man who wanted to make people laugh became The Joker. He's a little reminiscent of the clown in Steve Gerber's \"Night of the Laughing Dead\" in Man-Thing #5 (1974).The movie runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in New York City (Bronx, Harlem, Manhattan) and nearby New Jersey (Jersey City & Newark).GRADE: A-/A\n",

      "내용 :  For those wondering how a film about a comic book character, especially the Joker from DC Comics, could ever win an Academy Award, then join the doubters and watch this film JOKER: Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant in a role that is anything but comic in a film written by Scott Silver and Director Todd Phillips. Yes, the story, at the end, introduces the young Bruce Wayne aka Batman, in a subtle manner, but the message of the film is not the stuff of which DC/Marvel comics are made. This is a serious film about mentally ill people and the disinvolvement with a society that seems to care little about their status.Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) lives with his mentally impaired mother Penny (Frances Conroy) who is obsessed with communication with the mayor elect of Gotham City - Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). Arthur works in a clown studio and we meet him in clown costume and makeup as he is parading a sign about a store that is closing facing financial failure. A group of kids steal the sign from Arthur and upon chasing them, Arthur is felled and beaten. Arthur is stricken with Pseudobulbar Affect - spontaneous uncontrollable laughter - a condition that alters his responses to almost everything. On a subway, in his clown outfit, he is maligned by three 'Wall Street rich guys' and Arthur murders them - the beginning of his downfall. The bud of the schism between the haves and the have-nots (financial inequity) opens, and in the process Arthur discovers his father may be Thomas Wayne (the reason for his ex-housekeeper mother Jenny's constant letters) and Arthur goes to Wayne's mansion to meet - a major mistake and another mishap. Finally caught by the police after Arthur's clown face is posted on the news as the clown subway killer, and after guest appearing on the Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro) comedy show, Arthur breaks and is institutionalized while a city of clown-masked protestors against the wealthy booms. The ending is particularly dramatic: Thomas Wayne's son Bruce (!) - Dante Pereira-Olson) - ignites.Tough story to watch, but an important statement on many levels, this film deserves the honors it has received. Joaquin Phoenix is most impressive, as is the entire cast.\n",

He's a man in desperate need of help. Unfortunately, Gotham city isn't the place to find it. As his mind begins to shatter, Arthur has no idea what's coming his way. He simply finds his strength in a sudden act of violence, and somehow taps into the void within those around him, ultimately becoming a sort of messiah.The mesmerizing Mr. Phoenix uses his body as much as his dialogue to bring both Arthur and his alter ego to life.

So this was told to be the best flick of 2019, So many things were said and so I was afraid it was overhyped.Let me tell you, not one bit. First of all, happy to see Robert De Niro back in a flick that suits him. No more comedies please Robert. Secondly, the comparing all over the net between Ledger and Phoenix. They are both excellent in their own ways.The movie itself. Starts off rather as a normal flick, except for opening credits which took me back to the old WB logo's and yellow lettering of the seventies, but quickly turns into a dark movie getting darker and darker and more and more insane. The way it was shot, the score my God, really well done.And then there's the performance that couldn't beat Ledger. Well, Ledger I do still like as the Joker but what Phoenix did as the sart of the Joker is really really worth the Oscar. The skinny body, the laughter, the sick looks. with De Niro in it it did remind me of Taxi Driver who one person can turn from a desperate person into a mad person.Towards the end I was thinking, okay, so far 10 out of 10 but are they going to ruin the link towards Batman. They didn't, the last 15 minutes, man, it fits perfectly into the Batman world.It's been a while I have seen such a flick, and after some Marvel rather boring stuff (Avengers Endgame for example) again I was shown that DC is my thing.I can go on and on. The impossible mission to beat Ledger, well, the Oscars will proof that it has been done.Be warned, rated 16+, totally correct due the brutal action and the downward spiral of the storyGore 0/5\n",

That aside Joker is so much more than the comic figure we're used to. The Batman versus Joker war is not even important in this story, it's just about somebody that starts to lose it in the real world, someone that is just fed up with society, with the meaness of people. Maybe he has some mental issues but I'm sure a lot of people just understand perfectly why he becomes The Joker.

      "내용 :  I don't think it is a coincidence that Robert de Niro was an actor in this movie. Joker plays more like Taxi Driver than any movie I've seen. The same slow descent into madness for a disillusioned and ignored man at the edge of society.I didn't find the film political at all. Because what Phoenix did I felt for his character at a visceral level, beyond good, evil and morality. The entire movie is a joke that only some people get it. The incel thing, for example, was hilarious in retrospect: frightened first worlders trying to instantly put a label on the people that they feared most and needed support more. The exact same reaction as portrayed in the film. The story in this is very personal, in a social context that becomes a constant buzz that fades in the background.If there is any word that could describe Joker is uncomfortable. It's two hours of feeling the suffering of the main character, even as he breaks and does unconscionable things. You can't not root for him. You can't condone it. You can't not be sad. And in the end, when I was thinking this is a great movie but has nothing to do with the DC comics, it ties in the Batman classic storyline with such ease that I couldn't help shivering thinking on what Batman's story would be in this universe of burning sadness.Bottom line: great acting and really fresh ideas that work together perfectly. It's a very adult film, though, and not for everybody.\n",

      "내용 :  \"I used to think that my life was a tragedy, but now I realize, it's a comedy.\" Arthur Fleck aka Joker (Joaquin Phoenix)\n",
      "\"Joker\" has many faces, the two most prominent are tragedy and comedy. The tragedy is played amid murders and childhood abuse. The comedy comes intermittently, mostly as an accompaniment to the tragedy. Both modes amply identify Arthur Fleck, aka Joker, as a misfit and psycho, for whom only murder can make him feel alive.With the exception of Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, no better psychological study has come by than with Joaquin Phoenix as the troubled enemy of Batman. He may win the best-acting Oscar unless a more riveting anti-hero emerges before the end of the year.Besides Taxi Driver, another Scorsese influence shows Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a talk show host, who befriends Joker, a failed stand-up comedian. As in The King of Comedy, where De Niro's Rupert Pupkin pursues comedian Jerry Lewis, Joker \"befriends\" De Niro as talk-show host. Both films are aces at showing a character on the fringe of society, in Joker's case a nut job from neglect as an orphan, who kills Bruce Wayne's parents and his own mother.To see Arthur, evolve into Joker is to watch a master actor take a nerdy a-social kid to a serial killer, a fitting antagonist for Bruce Wayne, who saw Arthur murder his parents.Beyond the physical mutation of losing a Christian Bale-like fifty pounds, Phoenix consistently uses tics and laughs to emphasize how out of the center he is. The laughing condition, occurring randomly, is an apt metaphor for his inability to tell a joke or to fit normally in society. \"I just don't want to feel so bad anymore,\" Arthur whispers. It's hard to imagine he could ever feel well given he takes five different medications.As Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger showed, the joker character holds multitudes within his persona, enough for more than two hours of any film. Todd Philips directs an origin story about a psychopathic murderer who devolves along with the society he hates:\n",

      "내용 :  Many of us over the years have been attached and thrilled with the \"Clown Prince of Crime\" as D.C. comic fans know as the one and only \"Joker\". And we've seen different takes and spins from Romero's camp, to Ledger's dark wild crazy turn, and the man the one and only Jack played the clown with vanity and brought a proper turn to a bad guy while having fun(Nicholson's \"Joker\" was like that of the late 70's early 80's \"Joker\" in D.C. comics) now enter Phoenix who's much different with a creepy origin story.Set in the early 1980's Gotham city is gritty, raw and the social and political climate is in the gutter as just getting by is so tough. And just tip toeing and dancing his way thru the drama is Arthur Fleck(in a hell of a turn from Joaquin at least nominate him for a \"Golden Globe\" or \"Oscar\") a lonely and depressed mommies boy who's a skinny starving clown who just can't fit in he's a society misfit. It's really somewhat of a sad character study.However hope is possible in the form of Fleck wanting to get away from being a clown for children as his real dream is to be a standup comedian as his smile and crazy lasting laugh is always present! As laughter is the cure for his pain! His hope of escape is to appear on a late night talk show hosted by Murray Franklin(Robert De Niro) where Arthur hopes to showcase his talents. Also the only other wild card pleasure he has in his life is dating a single mom named Sophie(Zazie Beetz) from his apartment building. And his sick mother Penny keeps Arthur hanging on with love and hope as that keeps him hanging on.Only secrets and ghost of the past and painful memories only destroy the fragile mind of Arthur even more as a connection to millionaire Thomas Wayne is revealed and even more shattering is how this connection and more events will lead to \"The Dark Knight\". Great and excellent work from director Todd Phillips who despite making a stand alone dark character study still connects things up with others in the D.C. universe.Many might see this picture as a dark tragedy I think it's a take and spin on how one is affected by life and then they take on a different role after years of being abused and mistreated in the world by it's people. Still this film is excellent because it's unique and finally glad a stand alone movie celebrates \"The Joker\"(the greatest comic book bad guy ever!) As Joaquin's performance was raw, gritty, and a lashing out of some payback to society. Wow enough said best D.C. comics character study ever made!\n",

      "내용 :  Asserting as a one-off enterprise from DC universe and starting the original story of Arthur Fleck aka. The Joker (Phoenix) in 1981, director Todd Phillips (hailed from the THE HANGOVER trilogy fame), first thing first, has done a mind-blowing job in exbibiting a tangible retro flair from the film's imposing set design, a refuse-ridden, duck egg blue-hued Gothom City where anarchy is brewing at every sleazy corner, in tandem with Hildur Guðnadóttir's forboding symphonic score, it set the film's overall unforgiving keynote up to the eleven. And JOKER's closest kindred spirit might rightly be Martin Scorsese's seminal work TAXI DRIVER (1976), with a knowing nod to THE KING OF COMEDY (1982), not least hinted by Robert De Niro's presence here, and it palpably belongs to the veritable \"true cinema\" which Scorsese laments in his recent comments about DC's rival, Marvel's superhero movies.It is somewhat disconcerting (but not entirely unexpected) to learn Phillips' Venice Golden Lion winner is met with polarized reactions among critics stateside albeit being a legitimate box office leviathan by breaking all the October records in its opening week and audience simply adores it. Quite accountable, Phillips and his co-writer Scott Silver's script pluckily touches a raw nerve by lending an uncompromising view on the societal genesis of Arthur's violent predisposition - sowed by the disenfranchisement and impoverishment stonewalled by the plutocratic ruling class, represented by the future Batman's father Thomas Wayne (Cullen) and incited by the anomie and apathy Arthur faces on a daily basis....\n",

      "내용 :  In the non-canonical origin story Joker, Joaquin Phoenix plays a deeply disturbed man named Arthur Fleck as he experiences through a series of traumas that turn him into the notorious supervillain.Phoenix is terrific as the agonized loser with a compulsive-laughter condition. He's weird and creepy and full of angst and anger and self-loathing and everyone-else-loathing.The first half hour is simply a grinding, agonizingly slow moving portrayal of Arthur's life. Then there's a moment of stunning, electrifying violence. And then everything gets tedious again.Joker is not a supervillain movie, it's an artsy character study, and if you like those then this might appeal to you. But there's a superficiality to it all. Arthur is deeply disturbed and living in a city where society's have-nots are increasingly disenfranchised, but the script and director don't really seem to have anything to say about mental illness or inequality and injustice.In the run-up to the film, director Todd Phillips criticized \"woke\" culture and the far left, and perhaps that's part of the problem. Woke culture says we need to think about things deeply, and Phillips really, really seem loathe to delve into what it means to be mentally unstable and poor in the greater societal sense. He's only concerned with how it effects Arthur. Arthur is also only concerned with how it effects Arthur, and the result is a film that seems to accept that Arthur is a victim of an unjust society while never really considering why the society is unjust or how much of Arthur's problems might be the result of his own narcissistic self pity.But the main problem with the movie is it's slow-moving and dull far more often than not. I wouldn't recommend it.\n",

      "내용 :  STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningGotham City, 1981. A place in the grip of a sanitation workers strike, leaving bags of waste piled high in the streets. A place where the divide between rich and poor is cutting through the hearts and minds of the people. In the midst of this madness, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) struggles to live. An introverted, eccentric character who struggles to survive in the world. He's on various different forms of medication, and has a condition which causes an involuntary, loud, hysteric laugh to emanate from his mouth. However, after a devastating encounter with a group of bullies on the subway, he is plunged into a shattering series of events where his existence will come to have more meaning than he could have imagined.When the Batman TV series originally aired in the 1960's, there were an entire cavalcade of villains who graced the screen on a weekly basis, but since the character's inception, none of them have ever had quite the hold on the cultural consciousness as the Joker. Easily the most intriguing, ambiguous, and startling neer do well, with a dark charisma that draws you in more. In this, what may be the most successful film of the year, director Todd Phillips reimagines the character's origins, and provides a totally different slant on them, diverting away from the comic-book narrative, and instead using the character as a template for a searing character study, serving as a wider examination of society as a whole.Just as the lead character is framed in a different spotlight, so are some other characters from his background in the DC comics universe. While Thomas Wayne (here portrayed with a dour, judgemental undertone by Brett Cullen) has been depicted before as a millionaire with a heart of gold, investing his fortune to helping those from a more disadvantaged background, here we see him as a selfish, heartless tycoon, who looks down on those less successful than him. This casts an iffier slant on the motivations of the man who kills him, and young Bruce, who goes on to become Batman. It is in this way that Phillips skilfully demonstrates that good and evil/right and wrong may not always be as straightforward as they seem, and circumstances can dictate things.Arthur is a marginalised, misunderstood loner, unable to form regular, normal relationships with others, who can only get that connection from others by serving as a freak show to an audience, thus his attempts to break through as a stand up comedian, and his determination to appear on The Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro, in another of these roles that don't naturally suit him, but which he tries his best) Show, which ends up serving as a shocking springboard for him to gain admiration spreading a populist message.Many might feel comic book characters have been done to death, but Phillips has here delivered something truly original and compelling, a thought provoking examination of nature or nurture that will turn everyone on their heads, and has established Phoenix as a bona fide, big name star.****\n",

      "날짜 :  14 October 2019\n",
      "내용 :  Todd Philips' \"Joker\" has spread so many comments and controversy that I don't know exactly where to stand. The film reminded critics of Martin Scorsese's \"Taxi Driver\" and while Joaquin Phoenix' performance channeled the inner angst and alienation that drove the driver Bickle to an extreme -and bloody- corner, I found so many other sources of inspiration that if anything, \"Joker\" is the best tribute to the New Hollywood period.I found \"Network\" in the film, \"Death Wish\", references to \"The King of Comedy\", Marty's underrated movie about a man who wished to exist through the only talent he felt being endowed with... and naturally, there's something of \"A Clockwork Orange\" in the obscene stylishness the Joker embraces his new persona with. In a way, that the film met with controversy is logical, you can't make a social comment about violence and its dangerous appeal by sugarcoating it, violence like its enemies, use symbols and slogan, in fact, revolt is a mask that violence uses to operate undercover or is it the opposite? \"Joker\" is the slap today's audiences needed and that it used the Joker mask in our superhero era makes it even more relevant and accessible. But truth be said, any controversy the film should stir mustn't distract from the real deal.Indeed, any viewer familiar with one tenth of Phoenix' filmography knows the actor's ability to portray enigmatic and troubled characters with a dark side barely hidden, but even with that in mind it's impossible not to be blown away by his performance and compelled by his suffering. He shouldn't be the dark horse of the awards season but the frontrunner because his performance is so rich, so powerful, so intense and so bizarre and grotesque in a captivating way that it's almost like watching a movie within a movie, as if his distortable face was the operation theatre to his acting force, as if his nervous smile slowly turning into cries made a true symphony of pathos and anger. That actor is a treasure to Hollywood and here he's given the kind of rangy performances that can't do without earning awards. His snubbing would be controversy material if you asked me.Now, to the film. The first act immerses us in the life of Arthur Fleck, a clown and wannabe stand-up comedian. At first, I was afraid that the manic laughter scenes would be too redundant and turn themselves to cheap gimmicks, to remind us that we're dealing with the Joker, but no, Phoenix plays his Arthur as a man who's not a bad person. Raised by an over-protective and sickly mother, brutalized by kids who sees in a clown a living sign saying \"kick me\", humiliated by people who can't understand his medical condition, the point isn't to portray Joker as a martyr but a product of a specific environment and education, or lack thereof. Like anyone, he's got dreams, projects, but he's entrapped in a condition that makes it impossible to communicate or connect with the others except through hallucinations and would-happen moments, he's a misfit with a fragile condition that keeps worsening until it offers a platform for his dark psyche to perform.Does the film excuse him? No. Does it justify his actions? Hell, no. It just clarifies the need to perform that way. There's a point of no return reached in that psychological journey, when one humiliation too many triggers a strong desire to express itself through a sort of showmanship, something relevant in our days where people seek any ways to reach posterity. Set in what seems to be the early 80s, it puts Arthur in the same urban alienation context than Travis Bickle but with a passion shared with Rupert Pumpkin's and a \"mad-as-hell\" prophetic rage with Howard Beale's role. Near the end, there's a shot that follows one of the film's most shocking moment and it's an obvious nod to the anticlimactic finale of Lumet's masterpiece.But I can't insist too much on how good Phoenix his, one could see a few impersonations of Malcolm McDowell's dance when he \"punished\" his fellow droogs or get vibes from the two only performances that earned a posthumous Oscar, Peter Finch and Heath Ledger, still, there's something unique in that tormented role he inhabits with such a soul dedication that it makes Nicholon's Joker worse than the cartoon counterpart. ,\"Joker\" isn't dangerous but brave enough to question violence in the way it seems like the only plausible answer, it might titillate a few demagogue instincts but that's an unfair trial in the light of the recent events all over the world and that preceded the film. I walk often at night and see homeless people living in impoverished conditions, drowning their sorrows in alcohol and losing their manners once there's nothing to lose... and perhaps that's leaders' responsibility, praising democratic values while its application contradicts its own ideal. Anything is allowed when nothing is possible, is perhaps the biggest joke of all, and that it goes all downhill when the social budget is cut is perhaps the film's boldest stance against the shift between leaders and people.And that it used Bruce's father Thomas Wayne to connect the final act with a canon we're all familiar with is one of the many narrative delights of that character study and psychological thriller à la \"Woman Under the Influence\" where suspense doesn't come from a bomb but a ticking bomb of a soul. If De Niro's presence ties the plot with its chief inspirations, the film belongs to Joaquin Phoenix who gave a performance for ages, and a character who's relevant in the way he pits democratic ideals against urban reality. And my wish is to see another connection with De Niro with Phoenix winning an Oscar, it would be the second time for a character who already won one after De Niro with \"The Godfather Part II\".As for the glorifying violence trial... we've been there already.\n",

      "내용 :  'Joker (2019)' is one of the most intense and disturbing films I've seen in a long time. It really is surprisingly fantastic, an unsettling and complex character-study that's as uncompromising as it is gripping. Inspiration was clearly taken from 'The King Of Comedy (1982)' and, to a lesser degree, 'Taxi Driver (1976)', but this isn't just a cut-and-paste copy. It's very much its own beast, as much a horror movie as it is a comic-book one. Don't let Phillips fool you, by the way, this certainly is a comic-book movie. It's a phenomenal comic-book movie that blows almost all others out of the water, but a comic-book movie nonetheless. It takes inspiration from several well-known storylines and has a firm grasp on both its titular character and all the other classic Gotham elements, much more so than one might expect given the marketing. None of this is meant as a slight, just an exploration of the fact that comic-book movies are \"real\" movies. Here, we have a probable career-best performance from Phoenix, who's often frightening even when sitting still, and a definite career-best directorial effort from Phillips, who seems to have elevated himself far beyond the generally well-regarded 'The Hangover (2009)'. The whole thing is just so well-made, clearly crafted with absolute clarity of vision from the very beginning. The screenplay is great, the cinematography is gorgeous and the musical score is outright masterful. The flick works so well because it doesn't pretend there are 'heroes and villains'. You don't really identify with the protagonist, you pity him. You want him to be okay, to find a way out of his inevitably dark situation, but certainly aren't cheering along with him when things eventually get even worse. There's no 'good guy', just a guy. He undergoes some serious trauma and, often, the piece elicits a strong emotional response when this happens. Yet, when he decides to deal with it in a criminal way, you're never 'on his side'. Instead, you just watch in shock and horror, glued to the edge of your seat. Indeed, the violence here is some of the most impactful I've seen, each moment punching you straight in the gut. It's not fun, it's horrible and that's how it should be. There's no doubt that this is an amazing feature. It's absolutely gripping and I can't stress that enough. It gets under your skin and wriggles around, as interesting to reflect on as it is to watch. It's not exactly 'nice' but it's not supposed to be. It's brave, realistic stuff that's easily up there, right at the top, as one of the best of the year. As a footnote, I just can't believe how well they incorporated the Joker's classic laugh into a piece as grounded as this; it's chilling, tragic and integral to the character, yet still as over-the-top as you'd think (though, you might not realise it when it happens). Honestly, I still can't quite comprehend how good this whole affair is. It's simply divine.After a second watch, my option of the piece has dampened somewhat. It certainly doesn't have the impact that it used to. Plus, it clearly is a rip-odd of 'The King Of Comedy (1982)' that Phillips, by his own admission, simply slapped a 'Joker' title on so that producers would take notice. Still, it's an effective film overall. It's just not as effective as I initially though. I'll leave the rest of the review as it is, though, as I think there is some value in a 'first impression' of the piece; it clearly affected me the first time around, so deserves praise for that even if its impact has lessened on a rewatch.8/10.\n",

      "내용 :  A film about the Joker. What a great idea! Jared Leno must be delighted to be front and centre as arguably one of the most famous and recognisable bad-guys ever in popular culture. Unfortunately, DC's 'shared universe' ran into one or ten problems and has become fractured into... well, no one really knows what. Only that Jared Leno's 'Joker' appears to have been dumped after his woefully small appearance in 'Suicide Squad' and now Joaquin Phoenix puts on the clown make-up for the role.How 'Joker' fits in with what has been and what is left of DC's original attempt at bringing 'Justice League' together is anyone's guess. If you liked (or hated!) all those previous installments it doesn't really matter. Don't go into this film looking to see how it ties in. There might be a sequel, there might now. It doesn't matter. This film is so good that I almost hope it stays as a 'stand alone' film, just in case the quality deteriorates.Phoenix plays 'Arthur Fleck' (yup, no more 'Jack Napier' here!), a down-on-his-luck resident of Gotham City who struggles with his mental health issues while just about scraping a living working as a clown and looking after his sickly mother. It's rare that a film - even one that's mainly about a single individual - actually has that character in every scene. With 'Joker' there's rarely a minute where Phoenix isn't on screen... and therefore stealing the scene. Robert DeNiro is also on the cast list and - yes - obviously he's excellent (but he's not in it that much, so don't expect too much screen time for him). It's also interesting that many people also see the similarities of two of DeNiro's other work. If you've seen (and, if not, I recommend you watch) 'Taxi Driver' or 'King of Comedy' then you'll see more than a few nods here and there.I know that many recent Batman fans will say that there's no other Joker than Heath Ledger and us oldies will always say that Jack Nicholson did it best. I certainly won't argue with anyone who admires either of their performances, but Phoenix shows that, even stepping into their big clown shoes, he can still bring something new to the role.Yes, it's - technically - a superhero film, but it never really feels like one. There are no lavish computer-generated special effects of heroes/villains with superpowers. There are plenty of points which obviously link in to the whole 'Batman mythos,' but you could almost watch this film as more of a study of mental illness than an 'origin story' for the Joker.It may not be for everyone. Yes, it is brutal and there are some shockingly-real acts of graphic violence here and there. There's been a lot of speculation in the media about 'Joker's' hidden meaning and the impact creating a film about a villain and promoting them as a 'hero.' Personally, I don't think that anyone (sane) would ever commit any sore of crime because of a movie, even this one. One reviewer said it best when he said that there wasn't a massive spike in violent crime after the cinematic release of 'American Psycho' so why would there be one now with 'Joker?' The character 'Joker' - despite being the focus of the story - is never really shown as some sort of 'role model' for us all to follow. We may understand - some of - his motives, but anyone in their right mind would never truly wish to emulate him.I don't want to give away anything away about the plot as this is a film you really do need to watch yourself. I'm not one to say who should be in line for an Oscar. I don't know whether Phoenix will win one (probably not), but his performance is definitely worthy of praise.\n",

      "내용 :  Todd Phillips' 'Joker' surprised me. It was something completely different than what I expected from watching the trailers and reading the reviews written by those who saw the film before me. Apparently the film would belong to a genre that I would call extensions of superhero stories and specifically to the prequels sub-genre revealing the origins of some of the characters in these imaginary worlds, tracing the personalities and motivations of their actions before the first printed comic book or the first movie they appear in. The script of this film goes much further and dares much more. 'Joker' not only redesigns the map and image of the mega-city of Gotha, but also anchors it in a dark and violent world that painfully reminds us of our world and the contemporary events around us. The Joker character created by Joaquin Phoenix is a victim who becomes a vicious criminal, and the film is a study of a vicious mind and a journey to the roots of his violent revolt.The clown is one of the most versatile characters in the history of cinema. From Charlie Chaplin to the horror films written or inspired by Stephen King, clowns have represented the full range of human feelings, from sadness to happiness, from naivety to cruelty, from art to madness. The character created by Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix has all these plus he has something new to add. The aspiring stand-up actor who earns his living as a clown for rent is not only a persecuted and a marginal individual, a victim who rebels (it happened also to Charlot when he was getting upset) but becomes unwittingly a symbol of a collective revolt. Because of his bipolar personality, from a certain moment he does not discern between good and evil, just as we as spectators no longer discern between reality and what happens in his imagination. But his violence in the film is not only accepted but also taken as a role model by one half of the world rebelling against the order and inequality imposed by the other half of the world. I do not think that the film justifies violence in any way, but it does not hide it and it makes us ask questions about its sources.I don't know if Joaquin Phoenix will get the Academy Award for his role in 'Joker'. Maybe for some political reasons he will not be voted by a majority, or maybe an even more impressing role will show up. I think however that this fantastic role will become a reference and will be studied in acting schools many decades from now. I do not remember seeing such a complex study of a disoriented personality, of a victim becoming a murderer, of the personal downward spiral to hell in parallel with the social ascension in the eyes of some people around. Robert De Niro also has a remarkable supporting role, which makes us forget the actor's personality to bring to mind the image of the legendary TV anchors of the past. The city of Gotham seems different from the one in the Batman films, it is rather a New York from the early '80s, full of violent revolts similar to those we are experiencing in the present times. The film is grim and violent, interesting and ambiguous, melodrama and social criticism woven on a story where comic book heroes are just a pretext. My only reservation is related to the final scene, I found it superfluous and little related to the rest, maybe containing a symbolism that I confess I did not understand. Conclusion - 'Joker' is almost a masterpiece.\n",

      "내용 :  I might as well be the 9 millionth person to express their opinions on the Joker movie online, but I won't bring any sort of strong thoughts one way or another. I really liked the film, and even if the film doesn't have an intricate plot to dissect, there's certainly plenty to discuss. I've seen a ton of Joaquin Phoenix movies, and I'm not sure he's ever been better. Todd Phillips brings the best out of Phoenix and seems to have a blast playing in an entirely different sandbox than something like The Hangover or Due Date, instead something like Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy. Composer Hildur Guðnadóttir does a phenomenal job setting the aesthetic and tone with her unsettling score. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher brings something entirely new to the superhero genre. This controversial, provocative, and disturbingly violent film will more than likely be debated for decades to come. Perhaps more than anything else, this is cinema. (I'm looking at you Scorsese & Coppola)8.0/10\n",

      "내용 :  What can I say about it that hasn't already been said? It's not a terrible film, but it's not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it's trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it's not really sure what it's trying to say or if it's even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it's easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I'm not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it's also just not that interesting. It's kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That's a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a \"masterpiece\" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.\n",

It needed more action. The film is about the descent of a mentally ill man, failed by society, as he becomes more unstable and eventually leads to murder. He learns his mother has been lying to him and becomes unglued around her. The only thing I didn't get was this supposed to be the same Joker whom squares off with Batman. Because Bruce Wayne is just a kid and Arthur already looks to be 40 something. so how is that. And at the end he is in a facility, well how does he do the things the Joker did. Are we to assume he escaped or the Joker in Batman was a copy cat.FINAL VERDICT: Good film, but overrated. Worth checking out.\n",

      "날짜 :  10 October 2019\n",
      "내용 :  Put on a happy face and smile coz with Joker, the greatest comic-book supervillain at last gets his very own origin story, and it is exactly how it must be: Dark, bleak, deranged, manic, wretched & downright nihilistic. Also, with no good to counter the evil this time around, it is a full-on descent into madness & hysteria that viewers are either gonna detest or embrace wholeheartedly.Co-written & directed by Todd Phillips, this standalone take on the origins of the iconic arch nemesis attempts to create his psychological profile by painting a grisly portrait of an unstable mind that's hanging by a thread on the edge of insanity until he finally snaps. Discarding the existing blueprint of its genre, this reincarnation of Joker offers a low-budget, grounded treatment but with hugely rewarding dividends.Though Phillips' direction could dig into Joker's unhinged persona to only a certain extent, Joaquin Phoenix's chilling rendition of the eponymous psychopath bridges the gap and overcomes the few nitpicks with thrilling intensity, for he is gripping & breathtaking throughout. Other vital inputs come from the story's nihilistic tone & treatment, its grim atmosphere, sudden brutal violence, and Hildur Guðnadóttir's haunting score.Scarier than most horror films of today, Joker bestows the notorious madman with an origin story that's as plausible as it is cold & callous, and makes for an insanely riveting character study that works even if one strips the premise off its comic book roots. Driven by Joaquin Phoenix's powerful, unsettling & memorable performance, this cautionary tale of a psychotic who in search for identity mistakenly becomes a symbol is arguably the best film of the year.\n",

The funny thing is that there's a good reason why the movie isn't called \"THE Joker\". The creators said that the Joker might just be a persona various people took. Batman does in fact appear in this, but only as a small child. He's worked very well into the plot.I could really associate with what Joker was going through. He had been taking all these medicines yet none of them worked. He was angry at the rich for oppressing the poor. Him killing rich people at first really does inspire people. It really was a great study on the status of the richest and treats the story as very mundane. That was kind of already done in \"The Dark Knight\", but the focus is done so well here too. ***1/2\n",

      "내용 :  Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a troubled soul in Gotham City, a large metropolis similar to NYC. For one, he lives in a tenement with his equally troubled mother, Penny (Frances Conroy). From the subway, it is quite a trek up and down stairs to reach the place. Mentally unstable, with a raucous laugh which emerges like one with Tourette's Syndrome, Arthur regularly sees a counselor. A cocktail of pills helps him keep a part time job as a clown from an agency. One day, advertising a business on the sidewalk in his clown costume, teens steal his sign and subsequently beat him. Very upset, Arthur now \"borrows\" a gun from a fellow clown. Then, as a garbage strike continues and Gotham has to cut costs, Arthur's sessions are eliminated and he has no access to his medicines. All of this leads to Arthur dispensing \"vigilante justice\" on yuppies who mock and beat him on the subway. Suddenly, Arthur is famous, although his identity is not known. This leads Arthur to sink further into instability, trying to discover the identity of his father who Penny has hinted is a wealthy Mr. Wayne. More digging into his childhood history makes Arthur go full blown into vengeance and chaos. What will be the final result? This brilliant film is dark, almost pitch black, and bleak. Nevertheless, most will be unable to stop watching as its riveting story is played out. Phoenix is magnificent as the Joker, which very rightly earned him an Oscar. Robert De Niro is quite nice as a smug talk show host and the other performers compliment these two. The sets and art direction are also top flight wonderful, making the movie a wild landscape of chaos and sadness. Don't joke around and miss The Joker.\n",

      "내용 :  Greetings from Lithuania.I will be honest - i did not expected \"Joker\" (2019) to be this amazing movie. I saw trailer, i liked it, then read that it is heavily influenced on \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" and thought that its going to be at least an interesting and not by a numbers comic book movie. And i was right - its far from any comic book movie i have seen ever, except for \"Logan\" and \"Dark Knight\". Well, know there is a \"Joker\". What made those two films exceptional? Its that they went beyond and in different direction then you conventional PG13 comic book flicks from Marvel. \"Joker\" on the other hand is a great character study movie - first thing. If you would remove Gotham city and some characters from Batman universe, this film wouldn't even had anything to do with comic book movies. The other thing is that its just superbly done - this is hands down best movie Todd Phillips has ever made (and i loved first \"Hangover\"). Cinematography was gorgeous and very stylish, music was haunting and editing was top notch - this film at its running time 2 h run like wind for me. Oh ye, and then there is the best performance of the year (so far) by Joaquin Phoenix - his Joker i think stands on the same ground with a legendary performance by Heath Ledger - its that amazing, and a bit even more complex because in Dark Knight Joker was a side character - in here he is a central figure, and what a great character that was.Overall, \"Joker\" is a great character study movie, and a very unique comic book film. Its different, for sure and make no mistake its great not because its different - its because the bold direction creators have went with it and delivered it full. This is one of the very best films this year so far.\n",

      "내용 :  I just got out of watching JokerI have to say, it is really good... Possibly even great!! As a stand alone origin story, it's damn good. It moves at the pace of a 70's movie, so it may not be for everyone, but I found it mesmerizing to a level that it makes it an absolute winner. I think if they chopped about 15 minutes off the run time, it would have been better, whilst not missing a beat. There are elements of The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver as well as American Psycho.Now... Joaquin Phoenix might as well clear a space on his mantelpiece for an Oscar. I would be shocked if there is a better performance this year. The man is in every single scene. He carries this and at times, you forget that he is acting. His laugh is so real and twisted... The way he lost weight and transformed his body... The pain his character suffers and all the discoveries he makes that shape his life are just amazing and gracefully danced into a spectacular performance.There were a few predictable moments, but nothing to spoil the enjoyment!!Overall, this is a film to see, just to see one of the greatest actors of our time at the very top of his game.My screening was packed!! Only a spare seat here and there (annoyingly an ex and her new fella were in attendance🙈) second only to Avengers: End Game was was a complete sell out.\n",

Who am I to argue if it was such a huge box office success?It doesn't mean I have to agree, though. I can't help but wonder whether this would have been as successful if it was a standalone movie instead of a Batman prequel, and the fact that the audience were familiar with the Joker character.Unlike the Batman films, this is not a fantasy film. This is a drama - a rather slow moving drama, with great moments here and there. There were times when I actually found the film boring, tedious even. It wasn't a particularly special story, although it was interesting to see how Joker came to be. What made the film worth watching, was Joaquin Phoenix's incredibly chilling performance. (although all the laughing became annoying after a while). He certainly deserves an Oscar for this.The film has a good ending. In general, I don't believe the film is worthy of the hype.

      "내용 :  Joker (4 out of 5 stars).Joker is a psychological thriller film that Writer/Director Todd Phillips brings his own direction of the origin story of Batman's ultimate villain character. Joker is not the typical antihero superhero movie that most people would try to expect from. It is more of a character study of a character Arthur Fleck going insane and becoming a mad man when he realizes society has fallen in his eyes. Joker is a gritty, dark, and a surprisingly thrilling film. Definitely, one of those movies you will like it or hate it. This one does leave that haunting, spine chilling taste once it is over.The plot follows Arthur (Joaquin Phoenix) who sees human services for help regularly. He tries to take care of his mother Penny (Frances Conroy). He is attracted to his neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz). And he works being a clown and holding signs up. When human services are cut for budgeting. And his mother needs help medically. He sees that the people living in the low class area are struggling and forgettable towards the eyes of the rich. He slowly loses his mind and becomes the psychopath Joker.Joaquin Phoenix performance is off the charts impressive. Every single scene with Phoenix is great. He is impressive from the creepily body movements, his physique being underweight, and laughter is creepy. I feel like he is trying for the awards season. I can not compare him to other actors that have portrayed the roles. Heath Ledger will always be the best. Cause this is a different adaptation of Joker. This is more focused on a man who is slowly breaking away.The music score by Hildur Guonadottir is great. The music score delivers a spine chilling tone. It works with the atmosphere of the movie. The movie does deliver a good haunting origin story of Arthur becoming the mad man. Showing how wearing a clown disguise has an influence on others. And how others protest for the way society is treating them. Almost kind of scary that can be believable with the way things are in the real world with violence.However, I did find the direction with Joker to be kind of dull. It was great with performances, the origin story of Joker, and the music score. It is not one of those movies that is rewatchable after that one time. Do not expect any big action sequences, heroes fighting against the villain. This standalone movie is a grounded origin story. The movie does have some gritty and violent killings which may put some people at unease. I did love some references with characters which I will not give away cause of spoilers.Overall, Joker is a good psychological thriller film. Joaquin Phoenix is great with the role. The music score is good. Joker is one of those movies that leaves you with a disturbed taste from the character study. The movie will not be for everyone with its smaller budget and slow direction.\n",

      "내용 :  Whether you end up loving or hating Joker, Todd Phillip's gritty and Scorsese like take on the legendary DC comics villain, there's no denying that the cinematic comic book adaptations landscape has been changed forever.Just as Nolan changed our expectations for what a comic book film can be with his Dark Knight trilogy, Joker's examination of the birth of a nefarious villain hellbent on chaos and anarchy is unlike anything we've ever seen before, stripping the well known character back to the bare basics as we're introduced to the sad life of the misunderstood and unloved Arthur Fleck.Sharing more in common with dramas such as Taxi Driver and Serpico, rather than it's other comic book cousins, Phillip's and his mindbogglingly good leading man Joaquin Phoenix take us into the mind of a broken man trying to fit into a world that doesn't want to open its arms to him, in what's an engaging, cant look away character study that slowly but surely descends into a dark and uncomfortable place that befits the name and reputation of its title being.It may seem far to early to call but I for one am confident in saying that Phoenix's full embodiment of Fleck goes down as one of the most singularly impressive acting turns of not only the decade, but all time.Similar to what De Niro did as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, what Daniel Day Lewis did as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood and what Pacino achieved with Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Phoenix commands every second of screen time he gets in Phillips dark tale, in what must surely be the biggest sure fire bet for an Oscar you could ever hope to get.From the way in which Fleck appears physically, from a simple walk, through to a slight facial tick, right through to a haunting and hard to forget collection of haunting laughs, Phoenix appears in virtually every scene of Joker and never ones fails to enthrall, and in doing so his managed to do the seemingly impossible of allowing us to understand a deeply flawed and depraved creature but a creature you begin to understand and at times even feel sympathy towards.For all the great incarnations of the character, it's hard to think of a better way in which the Joker could be born into existence and by bringing his own flavour and nuances to Fleck, there's no point in comparing Phoenix to Heath Ledger's iconic take on the face painted mad man, with this take a whole different beast entirely.As good as Phoenix is, it would've only taken the film so far had Phillip's and his team not come to the party but for a relatively small budgeted film, Joker's astounding overall quality ensures it can comfortably sit in the top class of 2019 films.It's amazing to think that this is a film from the same man that gave us Old School and The Hangover but Joker sees Phillip's grow into a whole new level with his on point direction, that fits perfectly with Lawrence Sher's eye-capturing 70's like cinematography and Hildur Guðnadóttir's memorizing score, giving Joker an epic and unforgettable cinematic verve that brings it's A game too match its captivating leading man.While first and foremost a believable tale of a man pushed to the edge of his already teetering limits, Joker also manages to throw in a number of surprising narrative and comic book throwbacks that will be no doubt be discussed ad-nauseam by die-hard fans and naturally tie together Fleck's story to a much broader universe without ever feeling forced or unnatural, all within a tale that is as confronting and even topical as you'd get regardless of genre.Final Say -Bleak, beautiful and boundlessly inventive, led by a Joaquin Phoenix performance for the ages, Joker is an outstanding cinematic achievement that's sure to be talked about for years yet to come.5 French Fries out of 5\n",

      "This is definitely a character study, more than your average superhero movie, which has superb acting throughout, and an emotional storyline which touched me in many ways. The dark tone is set right from the beginning, were we follow Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian whose descent into insanity and nihilism inspires a violent counter-cultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying Gotham City. It did take me some time to get into the film because I didn't realise that the analysation of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) would go so deep, and the many knocks that he took throughout the film, along with his twisted family history, made it an extremely emotional ride. With his psychological problems, and society disregarding him, I couldn't help feeling sorry for Arthur, even though he committed several murders. It did make me think, \"What would I do in his situation\", and with no one to turn to, it's not a surprise that he turned out the way he did. You usually see concepts like this in documentaries, where they analyse the mind behind murderers, so that's why this movie is totally unique, and one of the best films of 2019. Joaquin Phoenix deserved every award that he received because his acting was out of this world. Most of his scenes were improvised, which meant that the director spent ages editing the final cut, so there are many different versions of the film on the cutting room floor. You definitely have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it because it can take you down avenues that you have never been before. When it had finished, it took me some time to get out of the dark mode, which is very rare, so I knew that the director produced something special. Personally, I think that it should have been released before Christopher Nolan's Batman because it would have fit perfectly together. It could have easily had nothing to do with DC, which I would have preferred in some ways because it touches on many elements that have nothing to do with the superhero universe. Anyway, I think it's a great achievement by everyone involved, and even though it wasn't intended on being a DC blockbuster, it's the second highest-grossing DC film to date, with Aquaman just ahead. That just proves that you don't need to have a massive budget, and a CGI extravaganza, to make a successful comic book movie. Brilliant!Round-Up:\n",
      "This movie was directed by Todd Phillips, who also brought you Frat House in 1998, Bittersweet Motel, Road Trip, Old School, Starsky & Hutch, School for Scoundrels, The Hangover franchise, Due Date and War Dogs. He's due to direct a Hulk Hogan biopic, which is in production, with Chris Hemsworth playing Terry Bollea, but the rest of the cast hasn't been named yet. As for this film, they plastered Robert De Niro's name all of the poster alongside Joaquin Phoenix, but I thought he was irrelevant to the plot. He did play a part in Arthur's complete conversion to the dark side, but I was expecting him to play a major roll in Arthur's life. I must admit, halfway through the film I called all of my friends because I thought that the Joker was Bruce Wayne's brother, which would have been a humongous twist in the franchise, but after watching more of the film, I realised that was a bluff. I'm amazed that it is the first R rated movie to make $1billion dollars, and that the director got his influence for the film from Alan Moore's comic \"The Killing Joke\", which tells the Joker's origin and descent into insanity, and the Martin Scorsese films Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and the King of Comedy. Sadly, Todd Phillips said he wants comic book movie fans to know that there is no chance of Joaquin Phoenix's villain and Robert Pattinson's Batman ever crossing over on the big screen, so this might be the last movie for this version of the Joker. I just hope that the upcoming DC movies take a leaf out of Joker's book!Budget: $55million\n",

      "제목 :  Joker maniacally descends into madness but really the joke is on us for watching it.\n",
      "날짜 :  10 October 2019\n",
      "내용 :  Let's start off with the opinion that automatically grants me a place in the minority club. I didn't like Joker. I'll say it again in case it offended you the first time. I really didn't like Joker. My initial apprehension of the introductory promotional material unfortunately succumbed to all the traps that I knew it would, despite my yearning for astonishment.Phillips' lauded portrayal of arguably the most famous comic book villain to ever exist, is a psychological character study on mental illness and the incitation of anarchic violence. The descent into one's own madness, driven by anger and self-loathing. For the uninitiated, this proves to be a lucrative viewing experience, particularly for a mainstream comic book film that is not relying on heavily equipped visual effects and exposition, and changes the sub-genre up rather substantially. Whilst I can get onboard with this new direction, to which Phillips given his experience in Hollywood comedy did a applause-worthy transition, it is in need of serious refinement and substance.Let's strip away the DC disguise. Removing the forced implementation of the Wayne's and any interrogation on Gotham City's ensuing chaos. What you actually receive is a vacuous psychosis that is as shallow as Fleck's ostentatious makeup. There's zero substance. Absolutely nothing. Fleck, aside from his pathological laughter, had minimal development. Infuriating given the promising start. His gradual decline into his own deterioration commenced with some empathy. Gotham's class war brewing in the subconscious, with Fleck receiving the brunt of the violence as he is attacked multiple times. This direction of the anarchic environment altering his mentality was, dare I say, perfect.Yet as soon as I attempted to envelop myself into Gotham's chaos, Phillips decides to push a mundane plot point regarding his family and actively forces it to be the trigger for Fleck's downfall. No. He completely missed the point. The social commentary on society's ignorance moulding the less fortunate into monsters was seemingly abolished early on. The examination of this broken class system that holds the foundations of civilisation, wealth and sanity. Gone. Phillips attempts to hark back to this preliminary theme by forcing Fleck to exert lines including \"is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?\", but it never once felt natural.Which seamlessly brings me to my next criticism. Phillips, mostly due to his previous features, does not comprehend subtlety whatsoever. As if he spells \"subtlety\" as \"obvious\". Examples? Well, Beetz' character for one. Underdeveloped and underused, but regardless of those criticisms there's one scene that summed up Phillips' comprehension of \"delicacy\", well, perfectly. Fleck's imagination. You know exactly the scene. The whole disappearing flashbacks. Apparently we couldn't grasp the issue, so Phillips needed to visualise it for us with our eyelids peeled back. Despite every supporting character playing a vital part to his downfall, they each were handled with the clumsiest of hands. The lavish talk show host Murray Franklin, whom Fleck idolises, only implemented to pay homage to Scorsese's 'The King of Comedy'.Phillips stating that Scorsese's work was a massive inspiration for Joker, considering the 'Taxi Driver' narrative structure, yet rarely dabbling into the empathetic tones that the aforementioned director effortlessly provided in his work. Almost as if Phillips was idolising Scorsese himself. Naturally, embodying his features consequently resulted in a derivative and unimaginative structure that merely borrowed ideas whilst never exploiting them fully.Which seems somewhat unfair on Phoenix who truly was the only captivating aspect to this feature. An electric performance that challenged him both physically, especially with the method acting that he relishes, and mentally. Chewing up every single scene, ensuring that the eponymous character is at the forefront constantly. There's no doubt in my mind he will win awards for this performance, it was that tantalising. Yet despite the nuances he adds to the character, such as the exaggerated running style, he unfortunately is overcompensating for the impassive screenplay.But there's also technical merit. Sher's cinematography highlighted the darkness manifesting within Gotham by exploiting shaded tints within the filter. Various drone and tracking shots provided variance from the often clinical approach. And the string-based score relating to Fleck's descent into madness was suitably engrossing.Regardless of the appropriation of real-world violence, the controversy surrounding mass shootings and the exploitation of mental illnesses, Joker fails to be the very thing it sets out to be. A character study. A psychosis on the mind. The one-dimensional direction prevented a multi-faceted examination from taking place. Want a better feature? Ramsay's 'You Were Never Really Here'. The exact same film, but only perfect. Oh, and Phoenix stars in it too. Because, with regret, Joker has the last laugh, bluntly pointing at us through its masquerading void.\n",

But an Oscar nomination?We chose to next watch the 2019 film Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood which was nominated for ten (10) Oscars this year and it is competing with Joker's eleven (11) nominations. I will be shocked if Joker wins any Oscars and even more shocked and disappointed if Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood does not win against Joker in any of their competing categories.Let's see if my rating of 3/10 holds true on Oscar night and if Joker gets shut out as I would anticipate it would.\n",

      "내용 :  It was refreshing watching \"Joker\" in the theater (AMC Raceway, Westbury, NY). It was really nice watching a movie that took a new approach to (somewhat) familiar material. It was nice seeing a movie that challenges the audience. For the most part, \"Joker\" succeeds in what it was trying to do. Writer/ director Todd Phillips and company deserve a lot of credit. The best thing about this movie is its look. It really feels like that time and place. The problem that I had with \"Joker\" is that it seemed to wear out its welcome after a while. Joaquin Phoenix gives a good performance. But if I was supposed to somehow sympathize with his character's plight, I didn't. I didn't really care about him or any of the other characters for that matter. When you watch a movie and don't really care about the people you're watching you can start to lose interest. I didn't look at my watch during \"Joker\" but I was tempted. Dishonorable mention: a miscast Robert De Niro.\n",

      "내용 :  Every few months we get a film that causes a flurry of discussion that goes beyond what happens onscreen. Joker is one such example, people in equal measure praising the film for its boldness or artistic flair and deriding it for its supposed shallow cynicism and familiarity; that's all without going into the social responsibility of releasing a comic-book movie this darkly realistic in its violence. I find all these discussions enriching and even convincing on different levels, except for one: dismissing it as derivative.\n",
      "Phoenix as Joker essentially gives us an autobiography of his pre-crime lifestyle in expectedly unreliable fashion. What's to be believed about his own perception of his origins? That's never made super clear. What is clear is that Phoenix commands the camera's attention. At over 2 hours, the film gets a little too precious about each moment; plenty of demented laughing scenes and unnecessary expositing could've hit the cutting-room floor and we'd lose nothing. And in a better world, we'd get a proper Batman film with this Joker wreaking his particular form of havoc on the Dark Knight. Still, Phoenix holds rapt attention, giving us one of the darkest cinematic outings in years.\n",
      "But not only do I think the film is much too upsettingly effective and technically impressive to be written off, but I think director Phillips and star Phoenix are wearing their influences so firmly on their purple-suited-sleeves, calling it derivative is like calling Coke Zero derivative; that's partially the point. Sure, it's a pale homage to much better films (Scorsese comparisons are fully warranted), but maybe its refreshing brashness and wider reach to modern audiences will send people to the more soulful 70s and 80s films of its ilk.\n",

I guess partly because of a huge hype (bomb scares etc) and partly because of a genuine terrific performance by Joaquin Phoenix.BUT beware all you folks who might expect to see another fun Batman-like movie, this story is genuinely depressing from start to finish. Depressing in an impressive, good artistic way though, but nevertheless really dark and bleak. I cant imagine anyone feeling cheery after having watched it.The story in a nutshell. Joaquin Phoenix is battling severe mental illness issues. Trampled, ridiculed and without any hope of a future he spirals out of control, yelling that a society gets what it deserves, when it mistreats the weak and the poor. And so it goes...Any bad? I dont know, I think I wanna see it a second time. I think Robert de Niro's part wasnt as good as I hoped for. I think the stories dynamic wasnt as gripping as I hoped for.The good: the incredible disturbing acting performance by Joaquin Phoenix. I'll think he'll get an Oscar for his performance.

      "내용 :  I tried to leave out all the noise surrounding \"Joker\" and just focus on my feelings having seen the film.Arthur Penny (Joaquin Phoenix) plagued with mental Illness and confidence issues murders three yuppies whilst on his way home from his job, as a party clown. His downward spiral into madness appears mirrored by Gotham City itself, where budget cuts have the city on the edge of breaking point. The clown murders become a focal point in the civil unrest and inspires rioting in the streets.There is simply no denying the glorious committed central performance from Phoenix. The weight loss, the body contortions, the portrayal of severe mental Illness. The Oscar is his, you might as well give it to him now, and it's well deserved. I remember writing a review of \"Quills\" when I was at University and I raved about him then and \"Joker\" is the crowning achievement of a career that's full of high spots and has many more years left to go.I can't generate the same enthusiasm for the film though. I found it .... inconsequential. I spent a lot of time afterwards wondering if it's because it's an origin story for a character (or version of the character) that we're unlikely ever to see again and so they'll be no second or third act to the story. That's not to say I think they should do another one, I don't see how tonally this Joker will work against a Batman, it's too grounded, too realistic - even more so than Christopher Nolan's films were. This Joker isn't a terrorist or a \"Clown Prince of Crime\", he's not interested in \"watching the World Burn\", he's just a disturbed guy with a handgun. I suppose, at heart, my criticism is that the plot isn't new, different or complex enough for my taste.From a technical standpoint, the film is well done though. Cinematography and historical recreation are excellent, the colour palette of the movie is striking and bold, and whilst nobody else really comes close to Phoenix's level the rest of the performances are pretty solid across the board. The soundtrack is excellent too and I like that it's dark and violent. But as I sit here now, I wouldn't want to see the film again for a few years - and even then it would be for the performance rather than the film itself.\n",

We can see why Phoenix won the Academy Award, as this great actor has done such a great volume of work, and this is his movie to shine. He does so much with his character, a brave acting feat. The movie too, plays Jokes on you, as you'll see. Granted, Joker is dark, but is just totally engrossing from start to finish, no matter where you watch it. We praise the joker's murderous actions too. De Niro as a scummy t.v. show host isn't shown enough, and we almost forget him, as being so engaged with Phoenix's brilliant take on the super villain. Joker is a deep character study, of alienation, humiliation, twisted imaginings, rejection, all those negatives. He isa truly tortured soul, his family history only amplifying that torture. The music is eerily terrific, and we so feel for poor old Arthur Fleck. The dark piece, had me laughing a few times, at some lines, and Phoenix's laugh though a trifle annoying, you wanna hear more. Way more than any other movie, this is one that demands your attention. No joke.\n",

      "내용 :  Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix in the titular role, is the origin story of the infamous Batman arch nemesis , taking place in Gotham in the 80s. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a man deep into mental health issues. He suffers from uncontrollable bouts of laughter, has deep-rooted self-confidence issues and is currently living in a city just on the brink of disaster. Not helping the matters is his situation as a life-in caretaker for his demented mother, and his dead-end job as a clown-for-hire. And then he gets that little push, to quote another Batman movie.What Joker is, beneath all the layers, is a never-ending spiral into insanity, madness and ruin. Whenever you think that there's a ray of hope, of sunshine, the movie pulls the rug underneath your feet. Whenever you start to feel any sympathy for Arthur, he does something heinous or ups the ante. Whenever you think you have found someone to root for in this film, they reveal an ugly side to their persona.And yet the movie has levity to it. As befitting the character. It's a horrible, depressing film, but it does get a chuckle out of you. Which makes everything that follows even more depressing. Which is the Joker, in a nutshell.Furthermore, it's absolutely gorgeously filmed, the dialogues are great, the characters have real bite to them, the 80s Gotham is fantastically realized and it's just topnotch film making all around.If I had to nitpick, I would say that the film didn't necessarily need the inclusion of Bruce Wayne into it. It doesn't ruin the narrative, but it also felt just a bit tacked on, truth be told. Still, a minor gripe at best.Very good film. Nolan's The Dark Knight is still a better Batman film, as far as I'm concerned, but this film is a contender.\n",

      "내용 :  \"Joker\" (2019 release; 122 min.) brings the origin story of Joker. As the movie opens, we are in Gotham City in the early 80s (late in the movie we see that \"Zorro the Gay Blade\" is playing in theaters). A guy named Arthur is working various gigs as a clown (driving foot traffic for stores, visiting children at the hospital). One day he is savagely beaten by a group of young thugs. Arthur is shaking up badly. Meanwhile he pursues his dream of becoming a stand-up comedian, but things aren't going very well with that either... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Todd Phillips, best known for \"The Hangover\" franchise. Here he goes a very different direction, bringing us the origin story of the famed Joker character in the DC Comics universe. Joker has been portrayed many times before (including Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger), but it typically came across like an over-the-top, caricature-like performance. Not so with Joaquin Phoenix. Here we truly get to understand the person that became Joker. Joaquin Phoenix is utterly brilliant, and I have zero doubt that he will pick up a Best Actor Oscar nomination (and many other accolades) for this. The script brilliantly reflects the chaos that existed in New York/Gotham in the late 70s/early 80s (garbage strike, super rats, etc.). Please note that this film is MILES away from your typical \"super hero\" movie a la Avengers. For one, almost no CGI to speak of. Instead this is a dark, brooding and intense psychological thriller and character study. It is for me one of the best surprises of the year, period.\"Joker\" has been playing in theaters for weeks now, and I finally went to see it this weekend. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at in a large theater was very well attended, and that tells you about the staying power of this film. If you like your comic super hero movies dark and intense, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.\n",

      "내용 :  I always remember when 'The Dark Knight' was made Christopher Nolan saying that they made a decision very early on not to explore the Joker's origins. I always thought that was such brilliant decision because the less known about the character the more intriguing he is. So when I found out a 'Joker' origin movie was coming I wasn't sure how I felt about it. Interestingly, now that I've watched the film, I'm still not sure how I feel about it. It is a really well made film and I feel like that is its saving grace. If it wasn't well made people would be saying this film should never have been made.Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of his life. What a treat it must be for an actor to be asked to play this character (Jared Leto aside of course). He is masterful to watch and considering he's onscreen for basically every second of the two hour runtime, the fact that he never makes a misstep is quite incredible. Robert De Niro on the other hand was one of the only bad things about this movie. Completely miscast and boy has he lost his acting talents. It was quite hard to watch at times.This is a very dark film. I'm so glad they gave them an R rating to work with. The film wouldn't be what it is without it. Be prepared though for a very depressing ride for the majority of the film. This isn't your typical upbeat 'Joker' that you're used to. It ca even be a little uncomfortable to watch at certain points. I would have really liked this to be another hour long and actually got to explore more of him once he actually became 'Joker'. It felt like we did all the hard work to get to that point and then only got a snippet of the payoff we wanted and deserved. Still though, this is a very fine film that is well worth your time and money.\n",

It's good that he does not randomly target anyone, Anyone that get hurt by the joker is someone who (he felt) hurt him. It's the perfect origin of a supervillain. Overall it's worth it to see that transformation.\n",

      "내용 :  What a brilliant left-of-field movie this is. In this boring staid cinema environment of franchises, sequels, prequels, remakes, reboots, who saw this coming? Ask yourself these questions: Who ever thought perhaps the most iconic villain in comic book history could have a moving origin story? Who thought that the world of DC comics could create a moving, and even realistic, portrayal of mental illness? Who would have thought that the guy responsible for obnoxious comedies like \"Road Trip\", \"Old School\" and all those Hangover movies was capable of making a movie that pays homage to classics \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" - without disgracing either film?You already know what the movie is about. It's not really complicated. It's not really even plot-oriented. Yes, this is the downward spiral of one Arthur Fleck, failed comedian, who comes to call himself Joker, and in his insanity inspires a revolution that could easily lead to him being crowned the Clown Prince of Crime. It's a gripping, moving character study, with a performance from Phoenix that may be the year's best.The hardest thing about mental illness, Fleck writes, in his Travis Bickle-esque journal, is that you have to pretend you don't have it. When he wrote that, he didn't realise what this movie teaches you: that normies might expect you to pretend, but there's a wide world of Joker types out there, people who never had a chance. When mainstream society spurns you, for better or worse, you are not alone.Robert de Niro, as the co-star, proves that 2019 is the year he was ready to stop messing around with garbage like \"Dirty Grandpa\" and take this acting thing seriously again. People were starting to doubt if he still cared. Those doubts end now.But yes, the real star of the show is Joaquin Phoenix. I began this review with some questions, but I left out perhaps the most obvious one:Who ever thought that the character of the Joker could be enriched with another portrayal that's good enough to rival the one Heath Ledger gave us in \"The Dark Knight\"?\n",

      "내용 :  In the early 1980s Gotham City has deteriorated into an incendiary cesspool of crime and apathy where the rich and powerful have cast aside lower-class residents like Arthur Fleck, a party clown who's been disregarded his entire life. In spite of this he aspires to make it as a stand-up comedian, but his troubled history and mental erosion have begun to strip away what remains of his sanity. If you're looking to bring a well-known comic book character to the big screen in a way that's never been done before then look no further: this relentlessly dark and morbid story from Todd Phillips (yes, same one from The Hangover) is a psychologically twisted and unnerving character study of a frightening individual's downward spiral and just how far he'll go to make a name for himself. Intense, riveting, allegorical but equally audacious, chaotic and off-putting with a sluggish first half, how much actual enjoyment is derived from watching it is in the eye of the beholder, but there's no denying the work of Phoenix (with shades of Christian Bale) who dominates the screen with his unflinching portrait of the damaged protagonist...not for the faint of heart. **½\n",

It is carried along most of the way by the outstanding performance of Joaquin Phoenix and a lax system and gullible society unable to put the obvious together that allows the morose Arthur Fleck to wreak havoc in plain sight.Nothing could live up to the film's hype and outside of Phoenix's stirring but admittedly overlong performance ( a little too many yoga poses) the film depends heavily on nostalgia (music, era, Scosese) to propel its meagre satiric moments. As far as the character, Peck is classic cliche loner, Travis Bickle as Paglacci hanging around his old haunts.Like all hateful Jokers, Arthur is imbued with the ability to take an incredible beating as he does here before rising from the ashes in Todd's apocalyptic uptown climax that is more nonsensical than parable.Featuring a performance for the ages Joker ultimately is a smug gratuitously violent slasher, its unintentionally comic moments watching the heavy handed Phillips maintain PC order amid all the chaos.\n",

      "내용 :  Uncomfortable close-ups with a broken man, struggling to cope in a broken city, without a flicker of hope from a broken society. Set in the very early 1980s, Joker goes out of its way to invoke all the dirt and grime of that era. The local news, the regional politics, the dark sense of a brooding civil discontent, it's all here, and not only are we transported back to an age that could've easily spawned such a fractured criminal figurehead, we're shown direct parallels in today's seemingly polished outward-facing veneer.Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing in that lead role, carrying the picture in an essential performance that alternately wows and disturbs. He wrings every last drop of power out of a difficult part, creating a beautiful sense of poetic, unsettling discord that's tough to watch but even tougher to tear one's eyes from. Even if we can't endorse his actions (the film also stops short of doing so), we can understand the series of tragic missteps that led up to them, and maybe identify a shard of that same mania tucked away in our own subconscious.It's both literal and metaphorical, concrete but ethereal. We never know if what we're seeing takes place in reality or in a hyper-realistic, drug-induced sense of imagination, as the two are so hopelessly, constantly intertwined. There's a logical explanation for almost every last one of the character's trademark quirks, most of the heartbreaking variety (particularly that violent, wrenching laugh), but are those the truth or more figments? Daring and ugly and spontaneously violent (the deaths in this film are shocking in their immediate finality), it's the kind of movie that stomps your teeth into the concrete and leaves you wondering where it all went wrong. The post-climax is a weakness, perhaps, its messaging too blunt and transparent, but that's a rather small gripe. I've been thinking about it all weekend.\n",

He then embarks on a downward spiral of revolution and bloody crime. This path brings him face-to-face with his alter-ego: the Joker. This film has a great sense of suspense, tension and dread. It really depicts how mental illness and society can tear people apart.The use of dark colors (Black, Brown, etc) really gives off the impression how gruesome and dirty Gotham can be. The use of music in this film really heightens the tension, the score really sells the transformation of the Joker.

The premise of the film sees a man with mental issues dealing with his life as he becomes more and more twisted and morphs into the supervillain The Joker. Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck in this film and I mean he has to be the favourite for the oscar next year. You feel every emotion watching this character and you are mesmerized when you watch his character on screen, I don't want to say too much about his character in this film as you should experience it without knowing too much. The question will become who was the better Joker Joaquin Phoenix or Heath Ledger and I have to be honest they are so different that I am so happy we have both performances to appreciate. Robert De Niro plays a show host in this film and it was just really nice to see De Niro give a great performance and seem like he actually cared about his role . I thought the guy the played Thomas Wayne also did a really good job in his smaller role and I felt he fit the character very well. however, my one critique for the film is some of the female supporting characters such as his mother and Zazzie Beetz characters aren't given the depth that the other characters have in the film and that was slightly dissapointing. The story is great seeing this individual go through their life and develop into this character, I can't say much about the story as you need to experience it for itself and make your own assessment. The script is fantastic, a brilliant mix of humour and drama that makes this an incredibly interesting film with a great lead performance. The style makes this film seem based in a somewhat reality and that makes it even more terrifying, yest there are some uncomfortable scenes but thye feel appropriate for the film that it being shown. Overall this is a truly fantastic character film that if you are a fan of character development then this is a film for you.\n",

      "내용 :  Before getting to the film proper I must say I think the score is quite good. It is hauntingly beautiful and wonderfully atmospheric. It is a shame that the music has to be associated with the resulting film. The score repeatedly ends up putting a shine of the film that it truly didn't earn. I greatly dislike the film but the score is one of the year's best.Anyway, there are any number of films that take on this general material of the alienated white guy who snaps because of the (alleged) mistreatment by society he receives. Just going from memory you have Taxi Driver (the film lifts the journal concept from it), King of Comedy (the film lifts the obsession with the comic from it), Falling Down (the exaggerated violence) and One Hour Photo (heavy handed symbolism). Joker most closely follows King of Comedy but it is a slew of all of these films. Quite frankly I don't think there is an original concept in the entire film. It all would be pitiable if such an aesthetic deserved pity.Worse the film's overall structure just lends itself to tedium. Fleck is an unreliable narrator-any number of scenes occur within his psyche and much of the film you see is narrative untrustworthy. I am sure there is a clear tell between reality and Fleck's delusions (clocks always have the same time by way of example) Whatever the solution is I don't think it matters. You still dealing with a warmed over re-hash of white men feeling left behind by society changing. It is either a projection of theirs (which it is) or society doesn't care about white male pain. (laughable) Regardless, the extra work you need to do to put the narrative in proper context isn't worth it. Traditionally, the Joker's origins are unknown and I think the film raises the distinct possibility that Fleck isn't really the Joker. The film feels like it goes nowhere.This emptiness is best captured by the only provocative moment in the entire film. For plot reasons I need not get into Fleck ends up in the Joker make-up *and* wearing a Joker mask. So a joker face is behind a joker mask. This mask-within-a-mask moment is central as the implication that Joker-ness is merely masks all the way down is too forceful to ignore. But if it is just masks all the way down the film is utterly unsatisfactory. The solution in the origin story film cannot be there is no solution. In any case, any number of scenes of Fleck being weird and edgy simply drag.I suspect I am rather cool to the overall picture because I don't particularly like Phoenix's performance. It is one of those engaging but bad performances that people mistake for great acting. It is not going to age well. Whether it is the laughing-while-sobbing moments or the ponderous delivery of the overwrought lines Phoenix is working much too hard. The performance is all flash and much like the film it is constructed out of far better work.. There is a bit of Crispin Glover here. There is some Travis Brickle. Ledger's Joker was clearly studied. And so on.It is simply perplexing that this film is making any waves at all in the award season.\n",

He became the gritty, grimy, troubled, wacky, and demented Joker and was also able to bring a tiny dose of sympathy. The music score paints a hauntingly eerie atmosphere with cinematography and color pallet that is spot on. The film is full of abstract emotional vignettes in his pre-Joker days. It had subtle to alarming examples where he was an outcast, even amongst fellow clowns, who frequently shunned by society and had a severely troubled upbringing; hence the sympathy. He has a strong desire to be funny, even a comedian and admired. What will it take for him to be accepted and respected? This film ran the gamut from subtle to extreme shock and really is virtually flawless...if you can tolerate the film's unsettling tone.\n",

Its intriguing throughout watching Fleck's metamorphosis into something quite edgy and creepy during the briskly paced running time.Phillips expertly injects violence that is hard hitting, that emulates the simmering and brutal kills of The Godfather, Goodfellas and the like with a tragic character and dark comedy at its core.It's a must see, if anything, it's arguably too well made to be a comic book movie.\n",

      "내용 :  To be fair, Joaquin Phoenix did a great job in this film. The dark, depressing mood is carefully cultivated by the director and cinematographer, who also do commendable work. However, the script suffers from another case of out-of-perioditis. This character and Batman belong in the 1930s, and screenwriters, directors and producers seem to make the same mistake over and over again by trying to put Batman and the Joker in the seventies or even a more modern era. The phony poor people killing the rich was far more likely to occur during the Depression of the 30s rather than the post WW2 era. I liked the Taxi Driver and King of Comedy tributes to DeNiro, But the film played more like Death Wish with the Getz killings copied almost identically to the real event. By the way, most rich people don't take the subways; they take taxis. Nice eye candy though. I hope Phoenix gets the Award, now that Sandler has been disrespected by the Academy by not even getting nominated for Uncut Gems.\n",

      "내용 :  Each to their own, as always, but for me: Incredible!I was fully aware of 'Joker' ever since its release, impossible not to be given the extraordinary hype that surrounded it, but it still absolutely surpassed my expectations - a sensational film. I adored every second of this; and I'm not even a Joker/DC Comics etc. 'fan'.Joaquin Phoenix gives an astonishingly outstanding performance as the titular character, undoubtedly one of the greatest showings that I've ever seen from an actor. I'm not one that takes notice of awards, but he is fully deserving of anything of that ilk that he won due to this. Quality!Everything else about the film is fantastic. Great score, great cinematography, great pacing... it's all just utterly superb and makes for a spectacular watch. I love that they avoided just going wall-to-wall crazy with this, don't get me wrong things get mad but there's more to it than just violence et al.I had presumed that I was going to enjoy this, but it honestly smashed any predictions I had about it before seeing it. Even after just one viewing, I can already state it's one of my favourite films. Excellent!\n",

      "The story of a man, mentally troubled, seeking much needed respect, digesting injustice after injustice until spiraling down the path of craziness and violence.Talking about Joker, to my taste, I would prefer a movie to be either about madness or about violence. Anything in-between and having fifty-fifty of either sides, IMO, wouldn't be really impactful and realistic and would sort of weaken the nice screenplay and plots.\n",
      "That's what happened to Joker, I tend to think.There is one way to remedy to that and that's by having a much lengthier runtime, narrating a much longer story-line with precision, meticulousness and more attention to details and events; something around 2h45m for this movie.\n",
      "If it had been done like that, keeping the twisted impressiveness with the longer runtime, it would have easily gotten a neat 10.(+) Great and award-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, whose role, I think, wasn't so hard for him, cause he's used to playing dark, brooding characters and that he's a Scorpion, greatly helping him exteriorizing those specific and alike emotions.(+) Nearly polished screenplay and superb development of character (one of the best ever depicted).(-) Some unrealistic events for the sake of drama throughout the movie and especially toward the end. Sort of reminded me of The Purge!(-) Too short of a runtime, impacting on the awesomeness and rating IMO, even with a sequel in view.If a sequel is ever to be made, it would greatly benefit from around 3h runtime, more madness and more Joker-like violence.You would then have a sequel that surpasses the first movie, which by itself is one of the best of the decade.\n",

It's stylish and atmospheric, both bleakly comedic and heartbreaking.

Truly OUTSTANDING piece of filmmaking that made me feel emotional & sorry for what Arthur has gone through in his terrible life but also how he goes isn't the best way but again it's totally understandable & i bet his actions will continue debate for years!!!

      "날짜 :  5 October 2019\n",
      "내용 :  Joker: Gotham City is a grim place to live in, refuse collectors on strike, social services being cut back, widespread violent crime, a sharp divide between the rich and the poor. The Joker works as a clown at an agency where the clowns have to punch in on a time clock. He gets the worst gigs, beaten up by kids when he's advertising a closing down sale. Loses his psychiatrist and medication due to the cutbacks. He has to look after his crazed invalid mother who writes to billionaire Thomas Wayne begging for help as she worked for him decades ago. Then he loses his job. All of this pushes him to breaking point.We have a killer clown pursuing his prey along subway trains and platforms. Long corridors in hospitals, apartment buildings, steep sets of steps. A city on the brink of class war. When three of his employees are slain by the Joker Wayne decides to run for mayor, on a 1% platform, calling the poor clowns. He gets his answer as mobs riot while wearing clown masks. They see the Joker as a hero. Some scenes of savage violence as the Jokers break from reality continues and his new villain persona emerges. Great scenes of hordes of clowns travelling by subway trains to protests and riots. Very much an adult version of the Joker with an outstanding performance by Joaquin Phoenix in the title role. Robert De Niro plays Murray Franklin a talk show host originally adored by the Joker. We get to meet Alfred and the young Bruce Wayne but this is the Joker's story. Writer, director and producer Todd Phillips delivers a dark origin tale which likely puts himself and Phoenix in the running for Oscars. 9/10.\n",

      "내용 :  Todd Phillips (Old School/The Hangover trilogy, scary to refer to them that way) foray into the comic book world comes in the form of this origin story. Following roughly along the lines of the graphic novella The Killing Joke (w/sprinkles of The Dark Knight Returns), this dark tale focuses on Arthur Fleck's (Joaquin Phoenix) struggles w/his own brand of madness, working a sorry job as a clown, caring for his home-bound mom who once worked for the Wayne estate (played by Six Feet Under's Frances Conroy who was also in DC's ill-fated Catwoman w/Halle Berry) & pining his hopes on becoming a successful comedian so much so that he'll get an opportunity to appear on his favorite late night talk show (whose host is played by Robert DeNiro) but the world he inhabits (reminiscent of the Big Apple's grungy grime of the 70's) infects his very soul where even his laughter seems to be killing him (posited as an extension of his Tourette's syndrome). When things start to spiral (a vicious attack by some youths as he tries to recover property they've stolen from him) & the eventual release comes when he stands up to 3 Wall Street types on a subway car, Fleck ditches his meds & finds new purpose to his being as he rises to meet his fate. Heavily influenced by 2 pillars of Scorsese filmdom (Taxi Driver & The King of Comedy), not to mention the stunt casting of DeNiro (star of both those masterpieces) provides a template for this narrative which feels like a strong performance shoehorned into a very familiar & predictable story-line but other than some lapses in faith in the audience attention span, the film works in spite of itself.\n",
